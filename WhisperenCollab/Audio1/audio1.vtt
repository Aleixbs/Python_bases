00:00.000 --> 00:05.540
But these are what I would consider to be full-stack users of geographic information systems.

00:05.760 --> 00:13.440
They create data, they analyze data, they integrate GIS data or location data with the business systems that run those groups,

00:13.680 --> 00:17.060
and they communicate with the public.

00:17.540 --> 00:22.080
So full-stack, they use the soup-to-nuts capabilities of a GIS technology.

00:23.180 --> 00:26.820
So is this approach and is this technology relevant in government?

00:26.820 --> 00:29.500
I'd say yes, we have evidence that it is.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.400
This is a map of the United States, obviously.

00:33.380 --> 00:38.480
The red dots represent the local governments that are using GIS as a core business system.

00:39.580 --> 00:42.200
It's literally tens of thousands of organizations.

00:42.420 --> 00:49.320
They range from large cities like Barcelona, like Madrid, like Singapore, like New York City,

00:49.540 --> 00:51.700
all the way down to very small municipalities.

00:51.940 --> 00:57.240
But it's proof that location and GIS is a core business system in government

00:57.240 --> 00:59.900
and is essential for media.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.320
There are four major areas that we see GIS really contributing to in government.

01:06.320 --> 01:13.820
First and foremost, and I'm going to give you an example of one in just a few minutes that cover an example of my community, where I live,

01:13.820 --> 01:16.820
how they use GIS for one specific thing that covers all of these.

01:16.820 --> 01:20.500
But the first area is planning and engineering.

01:20.500 --> 01:26.380
So the whole design of a community and how your community needs to be designed and how location can play a role in that.

01:26.380 --> 01:29.380
The second is around operational efficiency.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.220
So every government wants to provide good services to their citizens,

01:33.220 --> 01:36.220
both their citizens and their internal constituents.

01:36.220 --> 01:39.220
And location and spatial analytics can help drive that.

01:39.220 --> 01:44.220
Improving services in terms of efficiency, making sure that we're providing services to the right people,

01:44.220 --> 01:47.220
just making sure the very purpose of government is achieved.

01:47.220 --> 01:53.220
The third, I would go into this lower left-hand quadrant, is the ability to use spatial data

01:53.220 --> 01:57.220
to help make informed decisions or data-driven decisions.

01:57.220 --> 01:59.220
Location is an essential component.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
It's an essential component to that process.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
I would say it's a favored framework for understanding data, understanding your communities,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
and as a result, being able to make really effective decisions in your organization.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
It's like no other technology that actually exists.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
I often kid and say, you know, I've been in this business for 30 years,

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
and I've never seen a group of government officials huddled around a spreadsheet.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Not once.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
But I see them huddled around the maps, and I see them looking at dashboards.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
And that, to me, is really important.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
It's proof in the pudding that there's something special about the use of geographic capabilities.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
And the last component is around civic inclusion.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
And I would use that as sort of a broad term, because I would say it's civic inclusion,

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
but it's also inclusion or collaboration within organizations as well.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
There's something about using the geographic component that drives collaboration.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
There's a whole additional presentation that can be given on why this is the case.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
But there's something about using a map.

02:59.000 --> 03:07.000
Using a location reference to look at data that just captivates people.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
It helps identify ownership within a government.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Somebody owns everything.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
If you have a school that's not performing well, someone's responsible.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
If you have maintenance that's not being performed in a certain area, someone is responsible.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
If you have crime in a certain area, there's someone that's responsible.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
There's someone who's interested deeply in those characteristics or conditions in a given area.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
And just by having that location component, it drives engagement.

03:38.000 --> 03:47.000
On the civic side, we've heard for years the importance of communicating and collaborating with the public.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Governments are trying to do this all the time.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And one of the most common things that I hear from governments are,

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
we've invested a lot of time and energy in tools to engage the public,

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
and we just don't have the level of engagement that we're looking for.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
We know from our experience in working with our customers

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
that where there's a location component in those engagement solutions,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
there's an increased level of engagement.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
So why is that?

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
People are interested in crime, schools, capital improvement projects,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
whatever the subject may be.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
But they're really interested in how their government and their community is performing

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
in relation to where they live and where they spend their time.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
And that's why the location piece is so important there.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
So what do we know?

04:31.000 --> 04:40.000
Number one, we know that the way that communities are designed and managed matters.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
In just a minute, I'm going to share with you one aspect of the community that I live in.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
I can attest to this fact, number one.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
The services that you provide, the amenities that are maintained,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
they actually can change the behavior of the citizens in a community.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
There is absolutely no doubt about it.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
So putting the time and effort into planning and organizing and managing your community

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
has a direct impact on the health and viability of that community.

05:08.000 --> 05:15.000
Number two, governments are challenged today in ways that they've never been challenged before.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I would call them wicked problems.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
It could be everything from the cost of living, housing shortages, homelessness, crime, you name it.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
There are significant challenges that need to be faced today.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
So if you think that a community needs to be designed and managed properly,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
when you think about the challenges that exist today,

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
it just reinforces the need for the technology that you're seeing at this event

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
and the use of a technology like GIS to actually help governments achieve what they're trying to achieve.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
They have to use technology.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
They have to be creative at a human level.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
Apply human expertise to creating solutions to help cultivate and maintain really healthy communities.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
The last thing we know is that location is a key component to this whole entire process.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
You know, I spent the last couple of days visiting customers in this area.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
And when you walk around this convention center,

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
you'll see that there's maps and visualizations that use geography in just about every single booth.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
It is a core component to all information technology and all components of a smart city,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
or what we call a smart community.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
So location is central.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
I don't really think you can exist without it.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
So let me tell you a little story about where I live.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
This is a simple example of how location can be powerful and how it's used by a government.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I live in Boulder, Colorado.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
It's a city of about 100,000 people.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
It's a unique community.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
We have a tremendous amount of open space.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
So there's trails, there's a lot of outdoor activities, parks.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
We have a central business district.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
It's a very strictly planned community where there's a central density.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
We have commercial and residential homes.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
And then as you get outside, it's more open space.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
There's a series of amenities that I particularly take part in.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
We have an incredible...

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
For the United States, we have an incredible cycling infrastructure

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
for bicycle commuters and recreation.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
So we have over 300 miles of dedicated bike lane.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
It's sort of broken out.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
I broke them out over here.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
There's 96 miles of bike lane

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
that are on the road.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
There's 50 miles of bike paths, dedicated bike paths.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
There's no cars on it at all.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
It's like it's going to a highway system.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
And then 84 miles of multi-use path.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
You often don't have to cross a road on a bike.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
There's 80 underpasses in the city that go under busy intersections.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I'm pointing out these details for a reason

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
because the way cities are managed changes behavior.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I've lived other places.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I ride my bike 13 miles to work every day.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And the reason why I do it is because I never have to get on a road.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
So if you want to get cars off the road,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
you want to create a healthy community,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
it all starts with design and engineering.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
You build the infrastructure to support it.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
This is a community that's done that.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
So what do you think...

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
We have an active citizenry that takes advantage of this resource.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
So what would you suspect would be a major component of our...

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Like a priority that our community would have?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
It would be bicycle safety.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
And so part of being a smart community, part of being a smart city,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
is not just the technology that you use,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
but it's also the people that work in that organization

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
and their ability to understand what the priorities of their community are,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
leverage technology to help them make solid decisions

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
that reference those priorities and actually get things done.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
That's what makes you a smart community.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
You can wire up as many sensors as you want.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
You can take as many data streams as you want.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
You can automate whatever processes you want.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
But unless you can make this connection between technology

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
and actual work that has to be done to improve your community,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I don't think you're getting very far.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
So they've identified this as a priority.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
And what they've done here is first use a geographic information system

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
to analyze crash and accident data across the city.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
And they went through a process of collecting all the accident data.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
They break it down every way that you can imagine,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
including where there are pedestrian and cycling incidents.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
You can see them over here on the left.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
From this, they created hotspot analysis

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
to understand which roadways were the most dangerous of cyclists in this case.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
They used this information to populate, if you've heard of Vision Zero,

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
it's an initiative to reduce pedestrian deaths down to zero.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It doesn't just focus on cycling.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
It focuses on all pedestrian incidents and deaths.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
But of course, there's a cycling component to the whole thing.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
So the GIS analysis went into creating

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
their Vision Zero report,

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
which breaks down where the pedestrian death and accident

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
sort of situation in the community,

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
and then helping them prioritize where they actually can make improvements.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
And so then as a citizen, I can review that report,

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
but I can also go in and see where they plan capital improvement projects

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
based on that data.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
So it's not just going in and saying, you know,

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
you want to add bike lanes,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
but where should they improve the safety of bike lanes?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Where is it most important?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And they've identified nine major projects.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
There's one that's exceptionally important to me.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
So now we're getting back to why does it drive citizen engagement?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Well, I live right over here.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
And this road on the baseline happens to be

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
a common component of the bikeways that I use all the time.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
And guess what?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
It is not safe.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
It has not been safe.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
There's a bike lane, but it's not safe.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
So I have for many years wondered,

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
what are we going to do to improve the safety on this road segment?

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
Then there comes the GIS analysis on this road baseline

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
where they do all the engineering work and design.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
What amenities exist there?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
What do we need to add?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
It's sort of a bad map of that,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
but they've done the analysis of like,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
what can we do to improve this scenario?

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
All of this is available publicly to the citizens.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
So if you want to find any of this information,

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
just go to the website,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
look for capital improvement projects.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
We can walk you through this.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
This is an image.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I didn't take this.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I didn't create this.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
This becomes a visualization into that project.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
These are the existing bike lanes.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
You can see there's no barrier.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
It looks like there's a nice distance there,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
but trust me,

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
when you're riding on it,

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
especially in the snow,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
that's not enough.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
This is what the road looks like.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
They then have a visualization

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
where they can show you the improvements

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
they're going to make.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
And what's not on this slide

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
that I would want to communicate is

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
the first phase of the project,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
on this bike lane,

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
they put those flexible reflector things,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
and that seemed like it was great.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
About two weeks after they were installed,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
you see whole swaths of them

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
knocked over by cars.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Not a good...

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
It doesn't feel the same.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
It's not a good sense of comfort.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
What's available on the website

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
that you could look at would be...

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
What are the future enhancements?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
The future enhancements would be solid barriers

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
that they would have.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
So, of course, I'm like,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
okay, it's a possible future enhancement.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Is that ever going to happen?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Will it ever happen?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Well, I took this photograph last week.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
They've added the concrete barriers

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
on the side of the road.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
That's a much safer environment.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
But as a citizen, I was able to say,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
here's what my government did.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
They identified the challenge or the problem

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
that was a priority for the citizens.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
They did actual analytic work using a GIS

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
to understand where they could improve on that problem.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
They did the analysis.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
They created a report.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
They incorporated it into their capital improvement plan

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
and their process,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
and they executed against it.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
And all of it's available for me as a citizen

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
to watch and track.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
That, to me, is a smart...

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
an example of a smart community.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Now, if you ride a lot of bikes,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
and this is not a joke, but it's sort of funny,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
one of the things you get worried about is bicycle theft.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Well, they also have a dashboard

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
that tracks the amount of bicycle theft.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I'll just tell you the thing that's interesting

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
about this to me is this number.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
It just means that you don't want your bike to get stolen.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
So we have a map of the bikes,

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
but we're not recovering many of them.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
That's just the fact of the day.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
But we're tracking all of this for cyclists.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
So I'll close with a couple slides.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
What I would get to and sort of a message

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
or an advice I would get is

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
if what I said is true,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
location is important,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
governments that use GIS and location

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
as a way to help make their communities smarter

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
are doing well.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
It's a valuable technology.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
If that's the case,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
then I would suggest that all governments

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
should embrace geographic information systems.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
And they can embrace it across their organization,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
across the entire enterprise.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
And to do that effectively,

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
you really need to have a geospatial strategy.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
There's a process that you can go through,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
and there's many different processes,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
so I won't advocate one or the other.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
But have a process to go through,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
create a geospatial strategy

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
where you understand the data that you need,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
and most importantly,

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
get to the end of this process

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
where you understand the business solutions

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
that have the greatest impact on your organization.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
That's where you want to go to.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And then leverage the tools

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
that are appropriate to you

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
to actually execute that plan.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
One of the things that we've done as an organization

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
is we've identified over the past 50 years

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
the common work that governments use

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
our technology to support.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
So if you go into an engineering department

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
or a transportation department,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
there are common GIS applications

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
everywhere you go.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I saw them represented this week in Madrid

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
and in Barcelona.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
It's the same type of solutions.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
We have gone through and developed

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
a whole collection of over 200 ArcGIS solutions

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
that align to very specific domains.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
So if you're a city or a county

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
or a state agency,

15:32.000 --> 15:39.000
you can go onto the ArcGIS solution site,

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
peruse the different types of GIS applications

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
and have free access to the applications

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
and the code.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
So that we open source the actual code

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
so that you can actually enhance if you want to

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
or extend or localize in this case

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
any of these applications.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
These solutions and this gallery of solutions

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
also can provide you with a roadmap

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
for what your GIS implementation

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
in your organization can be.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
It will lay out to you the common solutions

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
in public works, in police, in emergency management.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Whatever department it is that you're in,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
it will lay out the common

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
cases for your organization.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
So you can leverage these solutions,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
buy them from a third party partner

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
or something similar,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
a similar solution.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Or if you have the resources,

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
you can use our developer tools

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
to create them yourself.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
But there's over 200 of these

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
available on the ArcGIS solution site.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
So again, what we know,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
the way communities are designed matters.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
It's not all about technology.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Technology is an enabler

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
to help us design communities.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
That's very important.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Number two,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
it's not getting easier to do this.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Because it's not getting easier to do this,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
we need to be creative.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
And again, I harp on this,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
but it's not just technology,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
it's technology plus people

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
to get creative and actually solve problems.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
And third,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
location is a central component

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
to that process.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Thank you very much.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
I'm around.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
We have our booth back here.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
I welcome you to come by our booth

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
and talk to myself

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
or any of the other heads.

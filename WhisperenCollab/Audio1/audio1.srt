1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,540
But these are what I would consider to be full-stack users of geographic information systems.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:13,440
They create data, they analyze data, they integrate GIS data or location data with the business systems that run those groups,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,060
and they communicate with the public.

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,080
So full-stack, they use the soup-to-nuts capabilities of a GIS technology.

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,820
So is this approach and is this technology relevant in government?

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,500
I'd say yes, we have evidence that it is.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
This is a map of the United States, obviously.

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,480
The red dots represent the local governments that are using GIS as a core business system.

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,200
It's literally tens of thousands of organizations.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,320
They range from large cities like Barcelona, like Madrid, like Singapore, like New York City,

11
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,700
all the way down to very small municipalities.

12
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,240
But it's proof that location and GIS is a core business system in government

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,900
and is essential for media.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,320
There are four major areas that we see GIS really contributing to in government.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,820
First and foremost, and I'm going to give you an example of one in just a few minutes that cover an example of my community, where I live,

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
how they use GIS for one specific thing that covers all of these.

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,500
But the first area is planning and engineering.

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,380
So the whole design of a community and how your community needs to be designed and how location can play a role in that.

19
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,380
The second is around operational efficiency.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,220
So every government wants to provide good services to their citizens,

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,220
both their citizens and their internal constituents.

22
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,220
And location and spatial analytics can help drive that.

23
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,220
Improving services in terms of efficiency, making sure that we're providing services to the right people,

24
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,220
just making sure the very purpose of government is achieved.

25
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,220
The third, I would go into this lower left-hand quadrant, is the ability to use spatial data

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,220
to help make informed decisions or data-driven decisions.

27
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,220
Location is an essential component.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's an essential component to that process.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I would say it's a favored framework for understanding data, understanding your communities,

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and as a result, being able to make really effective decisions in your organization.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's like no other technology that actually exists.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I often kid and say, you know, I've been in this business for 30 years,

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and I've never seen a group of government officials huddled around a spreadsheet.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Not once.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But I see them huddled around the maps, and I see them looking at dashboards.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And that, to me, is really important.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's proof in the pudding that there's something special about the use of geographic capabilities.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And the last component is around civic inclusion.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And I would use that as sort of a broad term, because I would say it's civic inclusion,

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
but it's also inclusion or collaboration within organizations as well.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There's something about using the geographic component that drives collaboration.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There's a whole additional presentation that can be given on why this is the case.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But there's something about using a map.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Using a location reference to look at data that just captivates people.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It helps identify ownership within a government.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Somebody owns everything.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If you have a school that's not performing well, someone's responsible.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If you have maintenance that's not being performed in a certain area, someone is responsible.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you have crime in a certain area, there's someone that's responsible.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There's someone who's interested deeply in those characteristics or conditions in a given area.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And just by having that location component, it drives engagement.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
On the civic side, we've heard for years the importance of communicating and collaborating with the public.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Governments are trying to do this all the time.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And one of the most common things that I hear from governments are,

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
we've invested a lot of time and energy in tools to engage the public,

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and we just don't have the level of engagement that we're looking for.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We know from our experience in working with our customers

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
that where there's a location component in those engagement solutions,

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
there's an increased level of engagement.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So why is that?

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
People are interested in crime, schools, capital improvement projects,

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
whatever the subject may be.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But they're really interested in how their government and their community is performing

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
in relation to where they live and where they spend their time.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And that's why the location piece is so important there.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So what do we know?

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Number one, we know that the way that communities are designed and managed matters.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In just a minute, I'm going to share with you one aspect of the community that I live in.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I can attest to this fact, number one.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The services that you provide, the amenities that are maintained,

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
they actually can change the behavior of the citizens in a community.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There is absolutely no doubt about it.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So putting the time and effort into planning and organizing and managing your community

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
has a direct impact on the health and viability of that community.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Number two, governments are challenged today in ways that they've never been challenged before.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I would call them wicked problems.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It could be everything from the cost of living, housing shortages, homelessness, crime, you name it.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There are significant challenges that need to be faced today.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So if you think that a community needs to be designed and managed properly,

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
when you think about the challenges that exist today,

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
it just reinforces the need for the technology that you're seeing at this event

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and the use of a technology like GIS to actually help governments achieve what they're trying to achieve.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They have to use technology.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They have to be creative at a human level.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Apply human expertise to creating solutions to help cultivate and maintain really healthy communities.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The last thing we know is that location is a key component to this whole entire process.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You know, I spent the last couple of days visiting customers in this area.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And when you walk around this convention center,

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
you'll see that there's maps and visualizations that use geography in just about every single booth.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It is a core component to all information technology and all components of a smart city,

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
or what we call a smart community.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So location is central.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't really think you can exist without it.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So let me tell you a little story about where I live.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is a simple example of how location can be powerful and how it's used by a government.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I live in Boulder, Colorado.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's a city of about 100,000 people.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a unique community.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We have a tremendous amount of open space.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So there's trails, there's a lot of outdoor activities, parks.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We have a central business district.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's a very strictly planned community where there's a central density.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We have commercial and residential homes.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And then as you get outside, it's more open space.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There's a series of amenities that I particularly take part in.

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We have an incredible...

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
For the United States, we have an incredible cycling infrastructure

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
for bicycle commuters and recreation.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So we have over 300 miles of dedicated bike lane.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's sort of broken out.

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I broke them out over here.

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There's 96 miles of bike lane

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
that are on the road.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There's 50 miles of bike paths, dedicated bike paths.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There's no cars on it at all.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's like it's going to a highway system.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And then 84 miles of multi-use path.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You often don't have to cross a road on a bike.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There's 80 underpasses in the city that go under busy intersections.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm pointing out these details for a reason

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
because the way cities are managed changes behavior.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I've lived other places.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I ride my bike 13 miles to work every day.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And the reason why I do it is because I never have to get on a road.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So if you want to get cars off the road,

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
you want to create a healthy community,

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
it all starts with design and engineering.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You build the infrastructure to support it.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is a community that's done that.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So what do you think...

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We have an active citizenry that takes advantage of this resource.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So what would you suspect would be a major component of our...

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Like a priority that our community would have?

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It would be bicycle safety.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And so part of being a smart community, part of being a smart city,

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
is not just the technology that you use,

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but it's also the people that work in that organization

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and their ability to understand what the priorities of their community are,

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
leverage technology to help them make solid decisions

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
that reference those priorities and actually get things done.

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's what makes you a smart community.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You can wire up as many sensors as you want.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You can take as many data streams as you want.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You can automate whatever processes you want.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But unless you can make this connection between technology

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and actual work that has to be done to improve your community,

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't think you're getting very far.

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So they've identified this as a priority.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And what they've done here is first use a geographic information system

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
to analyze crash and accident data across the city.

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And they went through a process of collecting all the accident data.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
They break it down every way that you can imagine,

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
including where there are pedestrian and cycling incidents.

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You can see them over here on the left.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
From this, they created hotspot analysis

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
to understand which roadways were the most dangerous of cyclists in this case.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They used this information to populate, if you've heard of Vision Zero,

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
it's an initiative to reduce pedestrian deaths down to zero.

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It doesn't just focus on cycling.

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It focuses on all pedestrian incidents and deaths.

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But of course, there's a cycling component to the whole thing.

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So the GIS analysis went into creating

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
their Vision Zero report,

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
which breaks down where the pedestrian death and accident

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
sort of situation in the community,

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and then helping them prioritize where they actually can make improvements.

167
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And so then as a citizen, I can review that report,

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
but I can also go in and see where they plan capital improvement projects

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
based on that data.

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So it's not just going in and saying, you know,

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
you want to add bike lanes,

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
but where should they improve the safety of bike lanes?

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Where is it most important?

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And they've identified nine major projects.

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There's one that's exceptionally important to me.

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So now we're getting back to why does it drive citizen engagement?

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, I live right over here.

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And this road on the baseline happens to be

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
a common component of the bikeways that I use all the time.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And guess what?

181
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It is not safe.

182
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It has not been safe.

183
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There's a bike lane, but it's not safe.

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So I have for many years wondered,

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
what are we going to do to improve the safety on this road segment?

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Then there comes the GIS analysis on this road baseline

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
where they do all the engineering work and design.

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What amenities exist there?

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What do we need to add?

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's sort of a bad map of that,

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
but they've done the analysis of like,

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
what can we do to improve this scenario?

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
All of this is available publicly to the citizens.

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So if you want to find any of this information,

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
just go to the website,

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
look for capital improvement projects.

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We can walk you through this.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is an image.

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I didn't take this.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I didn't create this.

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This becomes a visualization into that project.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
These are the existing bike lanes.

203
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You can see there's no barrier.

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It looks like there's a nice distance there,

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but trust me,

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
when you're riding on it,

207
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
especially in the snow,

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
that's not enough.

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This is what the road looks like.

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
They then have a visualization

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
where they can show you the improvements

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
they're going to make.

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And what's not on this slide

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
that I would want to communicate is

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
the first phase of the project,

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
on this bike lane,

217
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
they put those flexible reflector things,

218
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and that seemed like it was great.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
About two weeks after they were installed,

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
you see whole swaths of them

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
knocked over by cars.

222
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Not a good...

223
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It doesn't feel the same.

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's not a good sense of comfort.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What's available on the website

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
that you could look at would be...

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What are the future enhancements?

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The future enhancements would be solid barriers

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
that they would have.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So, of course, I'm like,

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
okay, it's a possible future enhancement.

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Is that ever going to happen?

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Will it ever happen?

234
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Well, I took this photograph last week.

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They've added the concrete barriers

236
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
on the side of the road.

237
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's a much safer environment.

238
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But as a citizen, I was able to say,

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
here's what my government did.

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
They identified the challenge or the problem

241
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
that was a priority for the citizens.

242
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
They did actual analytic work using a GIS

243
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
to understand where they could improve on that problem.

244
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
They did the analysis.

245
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They created a report.

246
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They incorporated it into their capital improvement plan

247
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and their process,

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and they executed against it.

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And all of it's available for me as a citizen

250
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
to watch and track.

251
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That, to me, is a smart...

252
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
an example of a smart community.

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Now, if you ride a lot of bikes,

254
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and this is not a joke, but it's sort of funny,

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
one of the things you get worried about is bicycle theft.

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, they also have a dashboard

257
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that tracks the amount of bicycle theft.

258
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll just tell you the thing that's interesting

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
about this to me is this number.

260
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It just means that you don't want your bike to get stolen.

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So we have a map of the bikes,

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
but we're not recovering many of them.

263
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's just the fact of the day.

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But we're tracking all of this for cyclists.

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So I'll close with a couple slides.

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What I would get to and sort of a message

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
or an advice I would get is

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
if what I said is true,

269
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
location is important,

270
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
governments that use GIS and location

271
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
as a way to help make their communities smarter

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
are doing well.

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's a valuable technology.

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
If that's the case,

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
then I would suggest that all governments

276
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
should embrace geographic information systems.

277
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And they can embrace it across their organization,

278
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
across the entire enterprise.

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And to do that effectively,

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
you really need to have a geospatial strategy.

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
There's a process that you can go through,

282
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and there's many different processes,

283
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
so I won't advocate one or the other.

284
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But have a process to go through,

285
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
create a geospatial strategy

286
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
where you understand the data that you need,

287
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and most importantly,

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
get to the end of this process

289
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
where you understand the business solutions

290
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
that have the greatest impact on your organization.

291
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's where you want to go to.

292
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And then leverage the tools

293
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that are appropriate to you

294
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
to actually execute that plan.

295
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
One of the things that we've done as an organization

296
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
is we've identified over the past 50 years

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
the common work that governments use

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
our technology to support.

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So if you go into an engineering department

300
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
or a transportation department,

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
there are common GIS applications

302
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
everywhere you go.

303
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I saw them represented this week in Madrid

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and in Barcelona.

305
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's the same type of solutions.

306
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We have gone through and developed

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
a whole collection of over 200 ArcGIS solutions

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
that align to very specific domains.

309
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So if you're a city or a county

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
or a state agency,

311
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
you can go onto the ArcGIS solution site,

312
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
peruse the different types of GIS applications

313
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and have free access to the applications

314
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and the code.

315
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So that we open source the actual code

316
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
so that you can actually enhance if you want to

317
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
or extend or localize in this case

318
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
any of these applications.

319
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
These solutions and this gallery of solutions

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
also can provide you with a roadmap

321
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
for what your GIS implementation

322
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
in your organization can be.

323
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It will lay out to you the common solutions

324
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
in public works, in police, in emergency management.

325
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Whatever department it is that you're in,

326
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
it will lay out the common

327
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
cases for your organization.

328
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So you can leverage these solutions,

329
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
buy them from a third party partner

330
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
or something similar,

331
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
a similar solution.

332
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Or if you have the resources,

333
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
you can use our developer tools

334
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
to create them yourself.

335
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But there's over 200 of these

336
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
available on the ArcGIS solution site.

337
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So again, what we know,

338
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
the way communities are designed matters.

339
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's not all about technology.

340
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Technology is an enabler

341
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
to help us design communities.

342
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's very important.

343
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Number two,

344
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
it's not getting easier to do this.

345
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Because it's not getting easier to do this,

346
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
we need to be creative.

347
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And again, I harp on this,

348
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
but it's not just technology,

349
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
it's technology plus people

350
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
to get creative and actually solve problems.

351

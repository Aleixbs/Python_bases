0	5540	But these are what I would consider to be full-stack users of geographic information systems.
5760	13440	They create data, they analyze data, they integrate GIS data or location data with the business systems that run those groups,
13680	17060	and they communicate with the public.
17540	22080	So full-stack, they use the soup-to-nuts capabilities of a GIS technology.
23180	26820	So is this approach and is this technology relevant in government?
26820	29500	I'd say yes, we have evidence that it is.
30000	32400	This is a map of the United States, obviously.
33380	38480	The red dots represent the local governments that are using GIS as a core business system.
39580	42200	It's literally tens of thousands of organizations.
42420	49320	They range from large cities like Barcelona, like Madrid, like Singapore, like New York City,
49540	51700	all the way down to very small municipalities.
51940	57240	But it's proof that location and GIS is a core business system in government
57240	59900	and is essential for media.
60000	66320	There are four major areas that we see GIS really contributing to in government.
66320	73820	First and foremost, and I'm going to give you an example of one in just a few minutes that cover an example of my community, where I live,
73820	76820	how they use GIS for one specific thing that covers all of these.
76820	80500	But the first area is planning and engineering.
80500	86380	So the whole design of a community and how your community needs to be designed and how location can play a role in that.
86380	89380	The second is around operational efficiency.
90000	93220	So every government wants to provide good services to their citizens,
93220	96220	both their citizens and their internal constituents.
96220	99220	And location and spatial analytics can help drive that.
99220	104220	Improving services in terms of efficiency, making sure that we're providing services to the right people,
104220	107220	just making sure the very purpose of government is achieved.
107220	113220	The third, I would go into this lower left-hand quadrant, is the ability to use spatial data
113220	117220	to help make informed decisions or data-driven decisions.
117220	119220	Location is an essential component.
120000	122000	It's an essential component to that process.
122000	128000	I would say it's a favored framework for understanding data, understanding your communities,
128000	132000	and as a result, being able to make really effective decisions in your organization.
132000	135000	It's like no other technology that actually exists.
135000	140000	I often kid and say, you know, I've been in this business for 30 years,
140000	145000	and I've never seen a group of government officials huddled around a spreadsheet.
145000	146000	Not once.
146000	149000	But I see them huddled around the maps, and I see them looking at dashboards.
149000	150000	And that, to me, is really important.
150000	155000	It's proof in the pudding that there's something special about the use of geographic capabilities.
155000	159000	And the last component is around civic inclusion.
159000	163000	And I would use that as sort of a broad term, because I would say it's civic inclusion,
163000	169000	but it's also inclusion or collaboration within organizations as well.
169000	174000	There's something about using the geographic component that drives collaboration.
174000	178000	There's a whole additional presentation that can be given on why this is the case.
178000	179000	But there's something about using a map.
179000	187000	Using a location reference to look at data that just captivates people.
187000	191000	It helps identify ownership within a government.
191000	193000	Somebody owns everything.
193000	197000	If you have a school that's not performing well, someone's responsible.
197000	203000	If you have maintenance that's not being performed in a certain area, someone is responsible.
203000	208000	If you have crime in a certain area, there's someone that's responsible.
208000	214000	There's someone who's interested deeply in those characteristics or conditions in a given area.
214000	218000	And just by having that location component, it drives engagement.
218000	227000	On the civic side, we've heard for years the importance of communicating and collaborating with the public.
227000	230000	Governments are trying to do this all the time.
230000	233000	And one of the most common things that I hear from governments are,
233000	237000	we've invested a lot of time and energy in tools to engage the public,
237000	241000	and we just don't have the level of engagement that we're looking for.
241000	244000	We know from our experience in working with our customers
244000	247000	that where there's a location component in those engagement solutions,
247000	249000	there's an increased level of engagement.
249000	251000	So why is that?
251000	256000	People are interested in crime, schools, capital improvement projects,
256000	258000	whatever the subject may be.
258000	263000	But they're really interested in how their government and their community is performing
263000	266000	in relation to where they live and where they spend their time.
266000	269000	And that's why the location piece is so important there.
269000	271000	So what do we know?
271000	280000	Number one, we know that the way that communities are designed and managed matters.
280000	284000	In just a minute, I'm going to share with you one aspect of the community that I live in.
284000	287000	I can attest to this fact, number one.
287000	292000	The services that you provide, the amenities that are maintained,
292000	296000	they actually can change the behavior of the citizens in a community.
296000	298000	There is absolutely no doubt about it.
298000	303000	So putting the time and effort into planning and organizing and managing your community
303000	308000	has a direct impact on the health and viability of that community.
308000	315000	Number two, governments are challenged today in ways that they've never been challenged before.
315000	318000	I would call them wicked problems.
318000	325000	It could be everything from the cost of living, housing shortages, homelessness, crime, you name it.
326000	329000	There are significant challenges that need to be faced today.
329000	333000	So if you think that a community needs to be designed and managed properly,
333000	335000	when you think about the challenges that exist today,
335000	339000	it just reinforces the need for the technology that you're seeing at this event
339000	345000	and the use of a technology like GIS to actually help governments achieve what they're trying to achieve.
345000	347000	They have to use technology.
347000	350000	They have to be creative at a human level.
350000	355000	Apply human expertise to creating solutions to help cultivate and maintain really healthy communities.
356000	362000	The last thing we know is that location is a key component to this whole entire process.
362000	367000	You know, I spent the last couple of days visiting customers in this area.
367000	370000	And when you walk around this convention center,
370000	375000	you'll see that there's maps and visualizations that use geography in just about every single booth.
375000	381000	It is a core component to all information technology and all components of a smart city,
381000	383000	or what we call a smart community.
383000	384000	So location is central.
384000	385000	I don't really think you can exist without it.
386000	389000	So let me tell you a little story about where I live.
389000	395000	This is a simple example of how location can be powerful and how it's used by a government.
395000	397000	I live in Boulder, Colorado.
397000	401000	It's a city of about 100,000 people.
401000	403000	It's a unique community.
403000	405000	We have a tremendous amount of open space.
405000	408000	So there's trails, there's a lot of outdoor activities, parks.
408000	411000	We have a central business district.
411000	415000	It's a very strictly planned community where there's a central density.
416000	418000	We have commercial and residential homes.
418000	422000	And then as you get outside, it's more open space.
422000	427000	There's a series of amenities that I particularly take part in.
427000	429000	We have an incredible...
429000	434000	For the United States, we have an incredible cycling infrastructure
434000	437000	for bicycle commuters and recreation.
437000	441000	So we have over 300 miles of dedicated bike lane.
441000	442000	It's sort of broken out.
442000	443000	I broke them out over here.
443000	445000	There's 96 miles of bike lane
445000	447000	that are on the road.
447000	453000	There's 50 miles of bike paths, dedicated bike paths.
453000	455000	There's no cars on it at all.
455000	457000	It's like it's going to a highway system.
457000	460000	And then 84 miles of multi-use path.
460000	463000	You often don't have to cross a road on a bike.
463000	469000	There's 80 underpasses in the city that go under busy intersections.
469000	471000	I'm pointing out these details for a reason
471000	474000	because the way cities are managed changes behavior.
474000	476000	I've lived other places.
476000	478000	I ride my bike 13 miles to work every day.
478000	481000	And the reason why I do it is because I never have to get on a road.
481000	483000	So if you want to get cars off the road,
483000	485000	you want to create a healthy community,
485000	487000	it all starts with design and engineering.
487000	489000	You build the infrastructure to support it.
489000	492000	This is a community that's done that.
492000	494000	So what do you think...
494000	498000	We have an active citizenry that takes advantage of this resource.
498000	502000	So what would you suspect would be a major component of our...
502000	504000	Like a priority that our community would have?
504000	506000	It would be bicycle safety.
506000	510000	And so part of being a smart community, part of being a smart city,
510000	513000	is not just the technology that you use,
513000	516000	but it's also the people that work in that organization
516000	519000	and their ability to understand what the priorities of their community are,
519000	523000	leverage technology to help them make solid decisions
523000	527000	that reference those priorities and actually get things done.
527000	529000	That's what makes you a smart community.
529000	531000	You can wire up as many sensors as you want.
531000	533000	You can take as many data streams as you want.
533000	536000	You can automate whatever processes you want.
536000	539000	But unless you can make this connection between technology
539000	542000	and actual work that has to be done to improve your community,
542000	544000	I don't think you're getting very far.
544000	546000	So they've identified this as a priority.
546000	551000	And what they've done here is first use a geographic information system
551000	555000	to analyze crash and accident data across the city.
555000	558000	And they went through a process of collecting all the accident data.
558000	560000	They break it down every way that you can imagine,
560000	563000	including where there are pedestrian and cycling incidents.
563000	565000	You can see them over here on the left.
565000	568000	From this, they created hotspot analysis
568000	573000	to understand which roadways were the most dangerous of cyclists in this case.
573000	577000	They used this information to populate, if you've heard of Vision Zero,
577000	582000	it's an initiative to reduce pedestrian deaths down to zero.
582000	584000	It doesn't just focus on cycling.
584000	587000	It focuses on all pedestrian incidents and deaths.
587000	590000	But of course, there's a cycling component to the whole thing.
590000	593000	So the GIS analysis went into creating
593000	595000	their Vision Zero report,
595000	600000	which breaks down where the pedestrian death and accident
600000	606000	sort of situation in the community,
606000	611000	and then helping them prioritize where they actually can make improvements.
611000	615000	And so then as a citizen, I can review that report,
615000	619000	but I can also go in and see where they plan capital improvement projects
619000	622000	based on that data.
622000	625000	So it's not just going in and saying, you know,
625000	626000	you want to add bike lanes,
626000	629000	but where should they improve the safety of bike lanes?
629000	631000	Where is it most important?
631000	633000	And they've identified nine major projects.
633000	637000	There's one that's exceptionally important to me.
637000	641000	So now we're getting back to why does it drive citizen engagement?
641000	643000	Well, I live right over here.
643000	646000	And this road on the baseline happens to be
646000	651000	a common component of the bikeways that I use all the time.
651000	652000	And guess what?
652000	653000	It is not safe.
653000	654000	It has not been safe.
654000	657000	There's a bike lane, but it's not safe.
657000	660000	So I have for many years wondered,
660000	665000	what are we going to do to improve the safety on this road segment?
665000	670000	Then there comes the GIS analysis on this road baseline
670000	672000	where they do all the engineering work and design.
672000	674000	What amenities exist there?
674000	675000	What do we need to add?
675000	676000	It's sort of a bad map of that,
676000	678000	but they've done the analysis of like,
678000	680000	what can we do to improve this scenario?
680000	683000	All of this is available publicly to the citizens.
683000	685000	So if you want to find any of this information,
685000	686000	just go to the website,
686000	688000	look for capital improvement projects.
688000	690000	We can walk you through this.
690000	691000	This is an image.
691000	692000	I didn't take this.
692000	693000	I didn't create this.
693000	698000	This becomes a visualization into that project.
698000	700000	These are the existing bike lanes.
700000	701000	You can see there's no barrier.
701000	703000	It looks like there's a nice distance there,
703000	704000	but trust me,
704000	705000	when you're riding on it,
705000	706000	especially in the snow,
706000	708000	that's not enough.
708000	710000	This is what the road looks like.
710000	713000	They then have a visualization
713000	714000	where they can show you the improvements
714000	715000	they're going to make.
715000	718000	And what's not on this slide
718000	720000	that I would want to communicate is
720000	722000	the first phase of the project,
722000	725000	on this bike lane,
725000	729000	they put those flexible reflector things,
729000	731000	and that seemed like it was great.
731000	733000	About two weeks after they were installed,
733000	735000	you see whole swaths of them
735000	737000	knocked over by cars.
737000	738000	Not a good...
738000	740000	It doesn't feel the same.
740000	742000	It's not a good sense of comfort.
742000	743000	What's available on the website
743000	745000	that you could look at would be...
745000	747000	What are the future enhancements?
747000	749000	The future enhancements would be solid barriers
749000	750000	that they would have.
750000	752000	So, of course, I'm like,
752000	755000	okay, it's a possible future enhancement.
755000	756000	Is that ever going to happen?
756000	757000	Will it ever happen?
757000	760000	Well, I took this photograph last week.
760000	762000	They've added the concrete barriers
762000	763000	on the side of the road.
763000	765000	That's a much safer environment.
765000	767000	But as a citizen, I was able to say,
767000	769000	here's what my government did.
770000	773000	They identified the challenge or the problem
773000	775000	that was a priority for the citizens.
775000	779000	They did actual analytic work using a GIS
779000	782000	to understand where they could improve on that problem.
782000	783000	They did the analysis.
783000	785000	They created a report.
785000	788000	They incorporated it into their capital improvement plan
788000	789000	and their process,
789000	791000	and they executed against it.
791000	793000	And all of it's available for me as a citizen
793000	795000	to watch and track.
795000	797000	That, to me, is a smart...
797000	799000	an example of a smart community.
799000	801000	Now, if you ride a lot of bikes,
801000	803000	and this is not a joke, but it's sort of funny,
803000	806000	one of the things you get worried about is bicycle theft.
806000	807000	Well, they also have a dashboard
807000	810000	that tracks the amount of bicycle theft.
810000	812000	I'll just tell you the thing that's interesting
812000	815000	about this to me is this number.
815000	818000	It just means that you don't want your bike to get stolen.
818000	819000	So we have a map of the bikes,
819000	820000	but we're not recovering many of them.
820000	822000	That's just the fact of the day.
822000	825000	But we're tracking all of this for cyclists.
825000	828000	So I'll close with a couple slides.
829000	832000	What I would get to and sort of a message
832000	834000	or an advice I would get is
834000	836000	if what I said is true,
836000	838000	location is important,
841000	843000	governments that use GIS and location
843000	847000	as a way to help make their communities smarter
847000	849000	are doing well.
849000	851000	It's a valuable technology.
851000	853000	If that's the case,
853000	856000	then I would suggest that all governments
856000	858000	should embrace geographic information systems.
858000	861000	And they can embrace it across their organization,
861000	862000	across the entire enterprise.
862000	864000	And to do that effectively,
864000	867000	you really need to have a geospatial strategy.
867000	869000	There's a process that you can go through,
869000	871000	and there's many different processes,
871000	873000	so I won't advocate one or the other.
873000	875000	But have a process to go through,
875000	877000	create a geospatial strategy
877000	879000	where you understand the data that you need,
879000	881000	and most importantly,
881000	882000	get to the end of this process
882000	885000	where you understand the business solutions
885000	887000	that have the greatest impact on your organization.
888000	889000	That's where you want to go to.
889000	891000	And then leverage the tools
891000	893000	that are appropriate to you
893000	895000	to actually execute that plan.
895000	898000	One of the things that we've done as an organization
898000	901000	is we've identified over the past 50 years
901000	904000	the common work that governments use
904000	906000	our technology to support.
906000	909000	So if you go into an engineering department
909000	911000	or a transportation department,
911000	913000	there are common GIS applications
913000	915000	everywhere you go.
915000	917000	I saw them represented this week in Madrid
917000	919000	and in Barcelona.
919000	921000	It's the same type of solutions.
921000	923000	We have gone through and developed
923000	926000	a whole collection of over 200 ArcGIS solutions
926000	929000	that align to very specific domains.
929000	931000	So if you're a city or a county
931000	932000	or a state agency,
932000	939000	you can go onto the ArcGIS solution site,
939000	942000	peruse the different types of GIS applications
942000	946000	and have free access to the applications
946000	948000	and the code.
948000	950000	So that we open source the actual code
950000	952000	so that you can actually enhance if you want to
952000	955000	or extend or localize in this case
955000	957000	any of these applications.
957000	960000	These solutions and this gallery of solutions
960000	962000	also can provide you with a roadmap
962000	965000	for what your GIS implementation
965000	967000	in your organization can be.
967000	969000	It will lay out to you the common solutions
969000	972000	in public works, in police, in emergency management.
972000	974000	Whatever department it is that you're in,
974000	976000	it will lay out the common
976000	978000	cases for your organization.
978000	980000	So you can leverage these solutions,
980000	982000	buy them from a third party partner
982000	984000	or something similar,
984000	986000	a similar solution.
986000	987000	Or if you have the resources,
987000	988000	you can use our developer tools
988000	989000	to create them yourself.
989000	991000	But there's over 200 of these
991000	994000	available on the ArcGIS solution site.
994000	996000	So again, what we know,
996000	998000	the way communities are designed matters.
998000	1000000	It's not all about technology.
1000000	1002000	Technology is an enabler
1002000	1004000	to help us design communities.
1004000	1005000	That's very important.
1005000	1006000	Number two,
1006000	1008000	it's not getting easier to do this.
1008000	1011000	Because it's not getting easier to do this,
1011000	1013000	we need to be creative.
1013000	1015000	And again, I harp on this,
1015000	1017000	but it's not just technology,
1017000	1019000	it's technology plus people
1019000	1021000	to get creative and actually solve problems.
1021000	1022000	And third,
1022000	1024000	location is a central component
1024000	1026000	to that process.
1026000	1028000	Thank you very much.
1028000	1029000	I'm around.
1029000	1030000	We have our booth back here.
1030000	1031000	I welcome you to come by our booth
1031000	1032000	and talk to myself
1032000	1034000	or any of the other heads.

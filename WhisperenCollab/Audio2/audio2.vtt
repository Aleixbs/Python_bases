00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
...in six municipalities and the second stage in April in another group of municipalities.

00:08.000 --> 00:19.000
It's expected that in the coming months the service will be completed in the last three municipalities to complete the group of 50.

00:19.000 --> 00:37.000
The number of trips has grown more. Currently, the number of trips on weekdays is on average 10,000 trips per day.

00:37.000 --> 00:48.000
Which, as you see in the red slide, is an average of almost five users per bank.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Thank you very much.

00:49.000 --> 01:03.000
Finally, in the next slide, you can see that the highest number of trips are made in the afternoon, from 5 to 8 p.m.

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
And the main stations in number of the trips are located in multiple hubs.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
I give the word to my colleague, Jordi, who will explain the experiential vision.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Thank you.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Thank you very much.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Good morning, everyone.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
I think, with the help of my colleagues, a lot of data has been provided.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
So, I think in just five minutes or less, I would like to share the data from Viladecan.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Because Viladecan is a city that met with the metropolitan city.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
That this service has been a very successful service.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
So, I will move the slide.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Very successful.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Very fast, the data.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
And then my experience and the experience that we have with the service.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
This is the network of the stations in Viladecan.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
We have 13 stations that are shorting the bike straight out by the city.

02:02.000 --> 02:14.000
And so, these stations provide more than 2,200 services per day.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
And so, this is the evolution of the users per month.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
In April, it was very high because it was the first time that...

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
In April, it was one of the most important cities in users.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
And then it has been decreased, as is normal.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
But now, in the last months, it has been established.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
So, this is a very common use, this service in the city.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
You can...

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Okay.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
The monthly rate is this number.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
It's a very large number of bikes.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
Bikes are used by the citizens, by the neighbors.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
And today, it's the average monthly rate of users who buy bikes.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And per day, it's around seven.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
So, seven uses of bikes per day and per citizen.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
So, it's a very interesting number.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
The total number of users divided by the rights of bikes equals.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
And then, my experience.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
I would like to comment the experience of Pilates Games and the users.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
The service is very...

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
The framework that we have in the city is to reduce emissions.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
We are a city that we have a goal to become a neutral carbon city in 2030.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
We are in line.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
We will need a green capital in 2025.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
The green leaf.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Because we have a lot of inhabitants.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
The green leaf.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
The city will be in 2025.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Mobility is the reference of 60% of the total emissions of CO2.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
The ocean carbon.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
The extra carbon.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
So, the mobility is one of the issues that we need to reduce emissions.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
So, this service is very interesting to reduce the emissions.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
And the second thing that I would like to share with you is that it is possible to move from

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
the middle gangs in the metropolitan city to Barcelona.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
This is in the north part of Barcelona.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
This is 17 kilometers.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
Cycling and electric bikes is around 35-40 minutes in all the paths with park lines.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
So, it is possible to move from Barcelona to Barcelona and from Barcelona to the middle gangs.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
Without this service, it was not possible to go cycling to Barcelona because your bike

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
maybe is not electric.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
We decided to have electric, the main bicycles.

04:47.000 --> 04:56.000
And the experience of my experience is, for instance, in San Giorgis day, in April 23,

04:56.000 --> 05:04.000
when I go to Barcelona from the middle gangs with bus, by bus, to share and to spend the

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
day in the book day in San Giorgis day, to come back to Barcelona to the middle gangs,

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I take the bicycle.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
And I last 35 minutes from Barcelona to the middle gangs.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
It has been the most efficient service.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
Much more than the bus because the time spent coming to the bus on Sunday is too long.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
And the train.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
We got the train, we moved to the center city and spent the time.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
And then the 15 minutes of the transit and then come back at home from the station to

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
my home.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
So, in bus it will be approximately one hour.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
From Barcelona to here in one Sunday.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
By train it is one hour and one hour and a bit more.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
And basically it was 35 minutes in Sunday.

05:52.000 --> 06:05.000
And sometimes I have gone to the middle gangs in Barcelona, working in the university.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
And if you are going to Baikara, this is a very busy city.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
This is a very mystery and surprise what would be the traffic.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Traffic jams is a common thing in Barcelona.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
If you use train, train, maybe train is not going to be working as it is needed to work.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
So, the bicycle is always the same time.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
40 minutes from the middle gangs to Barcelona.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
There is no traffic jams.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
And then you can run all the schedule on the line because the time is always the same.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
So, in this final collection it is possible to look by the metropolitan area of Barcelona.

06:37.000 --> 06:46.000
Cycling with the service is a very clean mobility and sustainable and healthy.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
So, all the topics that are in the health-free cities and the sustainable cities you visit

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
is behind this service.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
So, I think this service is a very, very, very future service.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
And it is to the very end of the line of all the frameworks that the cities will have

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
to become a better network city and to reduce emissions and pollution.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
So, I would like to thank you for the service.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
And I think that is a good way for this type of sales inside the city.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Thank you very much.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Can we have some questions?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I am a head of common sense.

07:36.000 --> 07:51.000
What about the infrastructure first? Of course, it takes so much time to go by line, but is it safe to sign it to Vila de Gans?

07:51.000 --> 08:07.240
Now, to be from Vila de Gans to Barcelona is safe, because we have all this in the top line, only the 17 km from Vila de Becs to Barcelona, and from Barcelona to Vila de Gans.

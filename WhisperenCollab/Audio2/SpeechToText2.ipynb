            "[01:00.000 --> 01:06.320]  There are four major areas that we see GIS really contributing to in government.\n",
            "[01:06.320 --> 01:13.820]  First and foremost, and I'm going to give you an example of one in just a few minutes that cover an example of my community, where I live,\n",

            "[01:16.820 --> 01:20.500]  But the first area is planning and engineering.\n",
            "[01:20.500 --> 01:26.380]  So the whole design of a community and how your community needs to be designed and how location can play a role in that.\n",
            "[01:26.380 --> 01:29.380]  The second is around operational efficiency.\n",
            "[01:30.000 --> 01:33.220]  So every government wants to provide good services to their citizens,\n",
            "[01:33.220 --> 01:36.220]  both their citizens and their internal constituents.\n",
            "[01:36.220 --> 01:39.220]  And location and spatial analytics can help drive that.\n",

            "[01:44.220 --> 01:47.220]  just making sure the very purpose of government is achieved.\n",
            "[01:47.220 --> 01:53.220]  The third, I would go into this lower left-hand quadrant, is the ability to use spatial data\n",
            "[01:53.220 --> 01:57.220]  to help make informed decisions or data-driven decisions.\n",
            "[01:57.220 --> 01:59.220]  Location is an essential component.\n",

            "[02:02.000 --> 02:08.000]  I would say it's a favored framework for understanding data, understanding your communities,\n",
            "[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  and as a result, being able to make really effective decisions in your organization.\n",
            "[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  It's like no other technology that actually exists.\n",
            "[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  I often kid and say, you know, I've been in this business for 30 years,\n",
            "[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  and I've never seen a group of government officials huddled around a spreadsheet.\n",

            "[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  But I see them huddled around the maps, and I see them looking at dashboards.\n",
            "[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  And that, to me, is really important.\n",
            "[02:30.000 --> 02:35.000]  It's proof in the pudding that there's something special about the use of geographic capabilities.\n",
            "[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  And the last component is around civic inclusion.\n",
            "[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  And I would use that as sort of a broad term, because I would say it's civic inclusion,\n",
            "[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  but it's also inclusion or collaboration within organizations as well.\n",
            "[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  There's something about using the geographic component that drives collaboration.\n",
            "[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  There's a whole additional presentation that can be given on why this is the case.\n",
            "[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  But there's something about using a map.\n",
            "[02:59.000 --> 03:07.000]  Using a location reference to look at data that just captivates people.\n",
            "[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  It helps identify ownership within a government.\n",
            "[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  Somebody owns everything.\n",
            "[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  If you have a school that's not performing well, someone's responsible.\n",
            "[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  If you have maintenance that's not being performed in a certain area, someone is responsible.\n",
            "[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  If you have crime in a certain area, there's someone that's responsible.\n",
            "[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  There's someone who's interested deeply in those characteristics or conditions in a given area.\n",
            "[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  And just by having that location component, it drives engagement.\n",
            "[03:38.000 --> 03:47.000]  On the civic side, we've heard for years the importance of communicating and collaborating with the public.\n",
            "[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  Governments are trying to do this all the time.\n",
            "[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  And one of the most common things that I hear from governments are,\n",
            "[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  we've invested a lot of time and energy in tools to engage the public,\n",
            "[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  and we just don't have the level of engagement that we're looking for.\n",
            "[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  We know from our experience in working with our customers\n",
            "[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  that where there's a location component in those engagement solutions,\n",
            "[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  there's an increased level of engagement.\n",
            "[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  So why is that?\n",
            "[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  People are interested in crime, schools, capital improvement projects,\n",
            "[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  whatever the subject may be.\n",
            "[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  But they're really interested in how their government and their community is performing\n",
            "[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  in relation to where they live and where they spend their time.\n",
            "[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  And that's why the location piece is so important there.\n",
            "[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  So what do we know?\n",
            "[04:31.000 --> 04:40.000]  Number one, we know that the way that communities are designed and managed matters.\n",
            "[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  In just a minute, I'm going to share with you one aspect of the community that I live in.\n",
            "[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  I can attest to this fact, number one.\n",
            "[04:47.000 --> 04:52.000]  The services that you provide, the amenities that are maintained,\n",
            "[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  they actually can change the behavior of the citizens in a community.\n",
            "[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  There is absolutely no doubt about it.\n",
            "[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  So putting the time and effort into planning and organizing and managing your community\n",
            "[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  has a direct impact on the health and viability of that community.\n",
            "[05:08.000 --> 05:15.000]  Number two, governments are challenged today in ways that they've never been challenged before.\n",
            "[05:15.000 --> 05:18.000]  I would call them wicked problems.\n",
            "[05:18.000 --> 05:25.000]  It could be everything from the cost of living, housing shortages, homelessness, crime, you name it.\n",
            "[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  There are significant challenges that need to be faced today.\n",
            "[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  So if you think that a community needs to be designed and managed properly,\n",
            "[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  when you think about the challenges that exist today,\n",
            "[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  it just reinforces the need for the technology that you're seeing at this event\n",
            "[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  and the use of a technology like GIS to actually help governments achieve what they're trying to achieve.\n",
            "[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  They have to use technology.\n",
            "[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  They have to be creative at a human level.\n",
            "[05:50.000 --> 05:55.000]  Apply human expertise to creating solutions to help cultivate and maintain really healthy communities.\n",
            "[05:56.000 --> 06:02.000]  The last thing we know is that location is a key component to this whole entire process.\n",
            "[06:02.000 --> 06:07.000]  You know, I spent the last couple of days visiting customers in this area.\n",
            "[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  And when you walk around this convention center,\n",
            "[06:10.000 --> 06:15.000]  you'll see that there's maps and visualizations that use geography in just about every single booth.\n",
            "[06:15.000 --> 06:21.000]  It is a core component to all information technology and all components of a smart city,\n",
            "[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  or what we call a smart community.\n",
            "[06:23.000 --> 06:24.000]  So location is central.\n",
            "[06:24.000 --> 06:25.000]  I don't really think you can exist without it.\n",
            "[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  So let me tell you a little story about where I live.\n",
            "[06:29.000 --> 06:35.000]  This is a simple example of how location can be powerful and how it's used by a government.\n",
            "[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  I live in Boulder, Colorado.\n",
            "[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  It's a city of about 100,000 people.\n",
            "[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  It's a unique community.\n",
            "[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  We have a tremendous amount of open space.\n",
            "[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  So there's trails, there's a lot of outdoor activities, parks.\n",
            "[06:48.000 --> 06:51.000]  We have a central business district.\n",
            "[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  It's a very strictly planned community where there's a central density.\n",
            "[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  We have commercial and residential homes.\n",
            "[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  And then as you get outside, it's more open space.\n",
            "[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  There's a series of amenities that I particularly take part in.\n",
            "[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  We have an incredible...\n",
            "[07:09.000 --> 07:14.000]  For the United States, we have an incredible cycling infrastructure\n",
            "[07:14.000 --> 07:17.000]  for bicycle commuters and recreation.\n",
            "[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  So we have over 300 miles of dedicated bike lane.\n",
            "[07:21.000 --> 07:22.000]  It's sort of broken out.\n",
            "[07:22.000 --> 07:23.000]  I broke them out over here.\n",
            "[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  There's 96 miles of bike lane\n",
            "[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  that are on the road.\n",
            "[07:27.000 --> 07:33.000]  There's 50 miles of bike paths, dedicated bike paths.\n",
            "[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  There's no cars on it at all.\n",
            "[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  It's like it's going to a highway system.\n",
            "[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  And then 84 miles of multi-use path.\n",
            "[07:40.000 --> 07:43.000]  You often don't have to cross a road on a bike.\n",
            "[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  There's 80 underpasses in the city that go under busy intersections.\n",
            "[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  I'm pointing out these details for a reason\n",
            "[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  because the way cities are managed changes behavior.\n",
            "[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  I've lived other places.\n",
            "[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  I ride my bike 13 miles to work every day.\n",
            "[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  And the reason why I do it is because I never have to get on a road.\n",
            "[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  So if you want to get cars off the road,\n",
            "[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  you want to create a healthy community,\n",
            "[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  it all starts with design and engineering.\n",
            "[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  You build the infrastructure to support it.\n",
            "[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  This is a community that's done that.\n",
            "[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  So what do you think...\n",
            "[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  We have an active citizenry that takes advantage of this resource.\n",
            "[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  So what would you suspect would be a major component of our...\n",
            "[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  Like a priority that our community would have?\n",
            "[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  It would be bicycle safety.\n",
            "[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  And so part of being a smart community, part of being a smart city,\n",
            "[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  is not just the technology that you use,\n",
            "[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  but it's also the people that work in that organization\n",
            "[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  and their ability to understand what the priorities of their community are,\n",
            "[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  leverage technology to help them make solid decisions\n",
            "[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  that reference those priorities and actually get things done.\n",
            "[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  That's what makes you a smart community.\n",
            "[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  You can wire up as many sensors as you want.\n",
            "[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  You can take as many data streams as you want.\n",
            "[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  You can automate whatever processes you want.\n",
            "[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  But unless you can make this connection between technology\n",
            "[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  and actual work that has to be done to improve your community,\n",
            "[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  I don't think you're getting very far.\n",
            "[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  So they've identified this as a priority.\n",
            "[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  And what they've done here is first use a geographic information system\n",
            "[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  to analyze crash and accident data across the city.\n",
            "[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  And they went through a process of collecting all the accident data.\n",
            "[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  They break it down every way that you can imagine,\n",
            "[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  including where there are pedestrian and cycling incidents.\n",
            "[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  You can see them over here on the left.\n",
            "[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  From this, they created hotspot analysis\n",
            "[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  to understand which roadways were the most dangerous of cyclists in this case.\n",
            "[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  They used this information to populate, if you've heard of Vision Zero,\n",
            "[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  it's an initiative to reduce pedestrian deaths down to zero.\n",
            "[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  It doesn't just focus on cycling.\n",
            "[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  It focuses on all pedestrian incidents and deaths.\n",
            "[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  But of course, there's a cycling component to the whole thing.\n",
            "[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  So the GIS analysis went into creating\n",
            "[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  their Vision Zero report,\n",
            "[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  which breaks down where the pedestrian death and accident\n",
            "[10:00.000 --> 10:06.000]  sort of situation in the community,\n",
            "[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  and then helping them prioritize where they actually can make improvements.\n",
            "[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  And so then as a citizen, I can review that report,\n",
            "[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  but I can also go in and see where they plan capital improvement projects\n",
            "[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  based on that data.\n",
            "[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  So it's not just going in and saying, you know,\n",
            "[10:25.000 --> 10:26.000]  you want to add bike lanes,\n",
            "[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  but where should they improve the safety of bike lanes?\n",
            "[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  Where is it most important?\n",
            "[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  And they've identified nine major projects.\n",
            "[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  There's one that's exceptionally important to me.\n",
            "[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  So now we're getting back to why does it drive citizen engagement?\n",
            "[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  Well, I live right over here.\n",
            "[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  And this road on the baseline happens to be\n",
            "[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  a common component of the bikeways that I use all the time.\n",
            "[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  And guess what?\n",
            "[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000]  It is not safe.\n",
            "[10:53.000 --> 10:54.000]  It has not been safe.\n",
            "[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  There's a bike lane, but it's not safe.\n",
            "[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  So I have for many years wondered,\n",
            "[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  what are we going to do to improve the safety on this road segment?\n",
            "[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  Then there comes the GIS analysis on this road baseline\n",
            "[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  where they do all the engineering work and design.\n",
            "[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  What amenities exist there?\n",
            "[11:14.000 --> 11:15.000]  What do we need to add?\n",
            "[11:15.000 --> 11:16.000]  It's sort of a bad map of that,\n",
            "[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  but they've done the analysis of like,\n",
            "[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  what can we do to improve this scenario?\n",
            "[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  All of this is available publicly to the citizens.\n",
            "[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  So if you want to find any of this information,\n",
            "[11:25.000 --> 11:26.000]  just go to the website,\n",
            "[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  look for capital improvement projects.\n",
            "[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  We can walk you through this.\n",
            "[11:30.000 --> 11:31.000]  This is an image.\n",
            "[11:31.000 --> 11:32.000]  I didn't take this.\n",
            "[11:32.000 --> 11:33.000]  I didn't create this.\n",
            "[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  This becomes a visualization into that project.\n",
            "[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  These are the existing bike lanes.\n",
            "[11:40.000 --> 11:41.000]  You can see there's no barrier.\n",
            "[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  It looks like there's a nice distance there,\n",
            "[11:43.000 --> 11:44.000]  but trust me,\n",
            "[11:44.000 --> 11:45.000]  when you're riding on it,\n",
            "[11:45.000 --> 11:46.000]  especially in the snow,\n",
            "[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  that's not enough.\n",
            "[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  This is what the road looks like.\n",
            "[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  They then have a visualization\n",
            "[11:53.000 --> 11:54.000]  where they can show you the improvements\n",
            "[11:54.000 --> 11:55.000]  they're going to make.\n",
            "[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  And what's not on this slide\n",
            "[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  that I would want to communicate is\n",
            "[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  the first phase of the project,\n",
            "[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  on this bike lane,\n",
            "[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  they put those flexible reflector things,\n",
            "[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  and that seemed like it was great.\n",
            "[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  About two weeks after they were installed,\n",
            "[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  you see whole swaths of them\n",
            "[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  knocked over by cars.\n",
            "[12:17.000 --> 12:18.000]  Not a good...\n",
            "[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  It doesn't feel the same.\n",
            "[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  It's not a good sense of comfort.\n",
            "[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  What's available on the website\n",
            "[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  that you could look at would be...\n",
            "[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  What are the future enhancements?\n",

            "[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  And they can embrace it across their organization,\n",

            "[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  And to do that effectively,\n",

            "[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  get to the end of this process\n",

            "[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  there are common GIS applications\n",

            "[15:32.000 --> 15:39.000]  you can go onto the ArcGIS solution site,\n",
            "[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  peruse the different types of GIS applications\n",
            "[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  and have free access to the applications\n",
            "[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  and the code.\n",
            "[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  So that we open source the actual code\n",

            "[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  or something similar,\n",
            "[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  a similar solution.\n",
            "[16:26.000 --> 16:27.000]  Or if you have the resources,\n",
            "[16:27.000 --> 16:28.000]  you can use our developer tools\n",

            "[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  So again, what we know,\n",
            "[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  the way communities are designed matters.\n",
            "[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  It's not all about technology.\n",

            "[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  but it's not just technology,\n",

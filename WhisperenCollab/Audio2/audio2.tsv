0	8000	...in six municipalities and the second stage in April in another group of municipalities.
8000	19000	It's expected that in the coming months the service will be completed in the last three municipalities to complete the group of 50.
19000	37000	The number of trips has grown more. Currently, the number of trips on weekdays is on average 10,000 trips per day.
37000	48000	Which, as you see in the red slide, is an average of almost five users per bank.
48000	49000	Thank you very much.
49000	63000	Finally, in the next slide, you can see that the highest number of trips are made in the afternoon, from 5 to 8 p.m.
63000	72000	And the main stations in number of the trips are located in multiple hubs.
72000	78000	I give the word to my colleague, Jordi, who will explain the experiential vision.
78000	79000	Thank you.
79000	81000	Thank you very much.
81000	82000	Good morning, everyone.
82000	86000	I think, with the help of my colleagues, a lot of data has been provided.
86000	93000	So, I think in just five minutes or less, I would like to share the data from Viladecan.
93000	98000	Because Viladecan is a city that met with the metropolitan city.
98000	104000	That this service has been a very successful service.
104000	107000	So, I will move the slide.
107000	108000	Very successful.
108000	110000	Very fast, the data.
110000	114000	And then my experience and the experience that we have with the service.
114000	117000	This is the network of the stations in Viladecan.
117000	122000	We have 13 stations that are shorting the bike straight out by the city.
122000	134000	And so, these stations provide more than 2,200 services per day.
134000	137000	And so, this is the evolution of the users per month.
137000	142000	In April, it was very high because it was the first time that...
142000	149000	In April, it was one of the most important cities in users.
149000	152000	And then it has been decreased, as is normal.
152000	155000	But now, in the last months, it has been established.
155000	159000	So, this is a very common use, this service in the city.
159000	160000	You can...
160000	161000	Okay.
161000	163000	The monthly rate is this number.
163000	166000	It's a very large number of bikes.
166000	171000	Bikes are used by the citizens, by the neighbors.
171000	177000	And today, it's the average monthly rate of users who buy bikes.
177000	179000	And per day, it's around seven.
179000	183000	So, seven uses of bikes per day and per citizen.
183000	186000	So, it's a very interesting number.
186000	190000	The total number of users divided by the rights of bikes equals.
190000	194000	And then, my experience.
194000	199000	I would like to comment the experience of Pilates Games and the users.
199000	203000	The service is very...
203000	207000	The framework that we have in the city is to reduce emissions.
207000	213000	We are a city that we have a goal to become a neutral carbon city in 2030.
213000	215000	We are in line.
215000	218000	We will need a green capital in 2025.
218000	219000	The green leaf.
219000	222000	Because we have a lot of inhabitants.
222000	223000	The green leaf.
223000	226000	The city will be in 2025.
226000	230000	Mobility is the reference of 60% of the total emissions of CO2.
230000	231000	The ocean carbon.
231000	234000	The extra carbon.
234000	241000	So, the mobility is one of the issues that we need to reduce emissions.
241000	245000	So, this service is very interesting to reduce the emissions.
245000	250000	And the second thing that I would like to share with you is that it is possible to move from
250000	253000	the middle gangs in the metropolitan city to Barcelona.
253000	255000	This is in the north part of Barcelona.
255000	260000	This is 17 kilometers.
260000	268000	Cycling and electric bikes is around 35-40 minutes in all the paths with park lines.
268000	275000	So, it is possible to move from Barcelona to Barcelona and from Barcelona to the middle gangs.
275000	282000	Without this service, it was not possible to go cycling to Barcelona because your bike
282000	284000	maybe is not electric.
284000	287000	We decided to have electric, the main bicycles.
287000	296000	And the experience of my experience is, for instance, in San Giorgis day, in April 23,
296000	304000	when I go to Barcelona from the middle gangs with bus, by bus, to share and to spend the
304000	310000	day in the book day in San Giorgis day, to come back to Barcelona to the middle gangs,
310000	311000	I take the bicycle.
311000	316000	And I last 35 minutes from Barcelona to the middle gangs.
316000	319000	It has been the most efficient service.
319000	325000	Much more than the bus because the time spent coming to the bus on Sunday is too long.
325000	326000	And the train.
326000	331000	We got the train, we moved to the center city and spent the time.
331000	336000	And then the 15 minutes of the transit and then come back at home from the station to
336000	337000	my home.
337000	340000	So, in bus it will be approximately one hour.
340000	343000	From Barcelona to here in one Sunday.
343000	347000	By train it is one hour and one hour and a bit more.
347000	352000	And basically it was 35 minutes in Sunday.
352000	365000	And sometimes I have gone to the middle gangs in Barcelona, working in the university.
365000	368000	And if you are going to Baikara, this is a very busy city.
368000	372000	This is a very mystery and surprise what would be the traffic.
372000	375000	Traffic jams is a common thing in Barcelona.
375000	382000	If you use train, train, maybe train is not going to be working as it is needed to work.
382000	384000	So, the bicycle is always the same time.
384000	386000	40 minutes from the middle gangs to Barcelona.
386000	387000	There is no traffic jams.
387000	393000	And then you can run all the schedule on the line because the time is always the same.
393000	397000	So, in this final collection it is possible to look by the metropolitan area of Barcelona.
397000	406000	Cycling with the service is a very clean mobility and sustainable and healthy.
406000	411000	So, all the topics that are in the health-free cities and the sustainable cities you visit
411000	413000	is behind this service.
413000	418000	So, I think this service is a very, very, very future service.
418000	422000	And it is to the very end of the line of all the frameworks that the cities will have
422000	426000	to become a better network city and to reduce emissions and pollution.
426000	429000	So, I would like to thank you for the service.
429000	435000	And I think that is a good way for this type of sales inside the city.
435000	438000	Thank you very much.
445000	447000	Can we have some questions?
453000	455000	I am a head of common sense.
456000	471000	What about the infrastructure first? Of course, it takes so much time to go by line, but is it safe to sign it to Vila de Gans?
471000	487240	Now, to be from Vila de Gans to Barcelona is safe, because we have all this in the top line, only the 17 km from Vila de Becs to Barcelona, and from Barcelona to Vila de Gans.

0	8320	We will give you money. Fantastic. I will open up my AI calendar or my AI application
8320	16120	and I will simply tell it in very simple terms. There is an application due with the city of
16120	24040	Costa Brava in Portugal on the 27th of November. I would like you to remind me two weeks in advance
24040	30700	to send my proposal to my suppliers, ensure that the costs are all okay, and one week in advance
30700	39200	set a reminder to discuss with my team our proposal. And like magic, AI creates all of those
39200	47900	meeting requests, all of the calendar information, everything. And it's more like an
47900	53680	intelligent assistant. So if I can transfer that now maybe to a city application,
54040	59820	we are from Dublin. Our company will install a lot of the traffic signals and coordinated controls.
60400	66500	We believe in the future at some point, AI will be introduced in such a way that we can tell us
66500	72520	on Saturdays, our biggest football team, Dublin, play at the major stadium.
73620	78300	Here is a list of all the fixtures and all of the times the matches will take place.
78900	84020	We know we can coordinate with the traffic signals because it's an adaptive traffic control system.
84040	89940	I'm sure something you are all familiar with. It uses already a primitive form of AI to detect
89940	95540	traffic jams and change the light sequences. But what if we were able to use AI to tell us
95540	102240	for half an hour or an hour before the match, give all the routes towards the stadium,
102580	109140	extended green time access, and after the match, if the team win, change all the lights to blue.
109260	113860	No, I'm joking. We won't do that. But there are so many ways we could,
114040	120660	but we can't use it. Our company was started about 20 years ago. Traditionally was a maintenance
120660	125620	company, but we decided we wanted to be the best smart cities provider in Ireland.
126020	132800	So we established two sub companies within ours, which is for software development and traffic
132800	139560	installations. That means we have our own team on the ground, able to install lights, sensors,
139560	143940	any type of application, and our own software engineers,
144040	150100	to create all of the AI, the backend, and the machine learning that's required to provide the
150100	157700	best AI for Dublin. One of our most interesting pilot projects at the moment is done in
157700	163580	coordination with partners in the UK and around. And it's a huge problem in cities where you have
163580	170580	tram intersections with vehicles. A vehicle approaches a red light at high speed, and you
170580	173900	know instantly they are not going to be able to brake in time.
174040	178840	So we decided to make the red light. Nine times out of 10, the driver carries through the red light
178840	185080	and crashes straight into the tram. This can cause problems, obviously, for losing a public transport
185080	189880	vehicle for a certain amount of time while it's under repair, and then also the devastation it'll
189880	196120	cause the passengers and the cars. Our pilot program at the moment, instead of trying to stop
196120	203980	the car, it can read the speed of the approaching vehicle, make an assisted, educated decision that
203980	211980	this car will not stop in time for the red light, and instead it will stop the tram. It'll remove any
211980	218060	possibility for the public vehicle to cross the path of the speeding car. Now if we were to try
218060	223340	and introduce that based on people, it would be impossible. You would need one person per
223340	229580	intersection 24 hours a day to watch it. However, one AI system could watch over every single
229580	233500	junction that has a sensor that is monitoring all this data.
233980	239980	Which brings me to my real point. The ability for us to introduce AI and systems like this in
239980	245520	the future comes down to sensors. It comes down to the quality of the data that we are able to
245520	252340	collect in real time and bring on our cities. Really, we know AI won't really impact our lives.
252540	258160	We have a lovely saying in Ireland and Europe that a society grows stronger when its residents
258160	263660	plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. And this is what it's about. It is our
263660	263960	job to make sure that we have the data that we need to make sure that we have the data that we
263960	270440	need to put in the sensors so that the next generation can create life-changing AI applications.
271480	277480	We have made a small sensor for one of my most favourite projects that we have at the moment.
278600	282760	There's a lot of drownings in Ireland and it's unfortunate because we are surrounded
282760	288440	by so much water. And the lunch boys that are used to save someone who is drowning
288440	293640	regularly go missing, being stag dudes, being people using them. At the moment they are not
293640	299320	intelligent devices. A ring boy is lifted, it is thrown in the water to save someone and it is gone.
300040	306600	We developed a small sensor that sits at the bottom of the ring boy housing. It tells the
306600	311800	council when there is a life boy sensor present, but more importantly when there is not.
313080	317640	This then triggers the council to go out and replace the life boy.
317640	323320	They are not at a great cost, but what happens is it saves a life by ensuring there is
323320	329640	constantly a ring boy at the location a person needs there to be. But as we start to introduce
329640	335400	AI in the future, and again with our partners in the UK we are discovering this, if we develop that
335400	341560	sensor to a point where we know that it is being used or it can prove that the ring boy is being
341560	348840	used in an emergency situation and someone's life is in danger, that exact same trigger can be used
348840	353240	to send out drones to find where the person is in the water. It can be used to find where the person is in the water.
353720	360280	I give an exact GPS location. If the drone then confirms someone is drowning, it can trigger the
360280	366920	emergency response to the location to make sure that person is saved in time at the exact location
366920	374360	where they are in peril. It's a fantastic opportunity to utilize all of the technologies
374360	379640	that are available to us and we are very excited to keep developing this sensor and more.
380280	383160	If you are interested, we will be doing a demonstration
383320	391720	of this full system. Neil might have to tell me the exact location. It's the Smart Dublin stand
391720	397560	at three o'clock today. We have designed all of the software, all of the hardware,
397560	402440	and currently there are 600 of these sensors installed around Ireland at the moment.
409720	413240	I don't have a huge amount of time left, but I would like to thank
413320	419640	you for your participation and listening as cleanly as you have. As I said, Neil and I will
419640	424600	be on the Smart Dublin stand for most of the day. We can take you through all of our other
425160	431240	applications of AI that we are using, but we firmly believe that this is the future
431240	438120	of smart cities and the sooner we can start to see it as an assisted intelligence instead
438120	442680	of an artificial intelligence, the better all of our cities and public spaces will be.
443320	445560	Thank you for your time. Welcome any questions.
449320	450760	Give it up to Gengover, everyone.
452520	458040	All right. Well, thank you very much for this very interesting presentation and how we are putting
458040	465640	safety of our users first. Now, we still have maybe just about five minutes in case anybody
465640	471880	would want to ask a question. We have the microphone here in the front, so don't be shy.
471880	473000	Come over and ask a question.
474200	477320	It's always hard to speak the first. Nobody wants to speak at the start.
477320	478520	Who wants to break the ice?
481320	485480	Anyone? Then Ken, in the meantime, because we discussed that
486360	492440	before, the other day in our call. How much do you use AI in your day-to-day life? How many
492440	493320	times do you use it per day?
494920	500280	No, I do. I use it a lot. I gave the example at the start of using it to control my calendar,
500280	503320	using it as an assistant to set reminders. I'm an assistant to a standard system, which I'm an
503320	508920	extremely forgetful i'm sure some of you are fantastic at making notes at conferences and
508920	515100	putting them into your calendar and all that but it is almost impossible for me i tend to
515100	520260	months after the event find a scrambled up piece of paper at the bottom of my bag and go oh they
520260	525280	were the notes i took on the day whereas now with ai technologies and it's as simple as the
525280	530640	microsoft applications yesterday microsoft were on stage with open ai talking about their
530640	536300	partnership they had their developer conference and most of the applications for ai are already
536300	542360	in your computer it's not something you have to download or sign up to chat gbt for turbo
542360	549740	even microsoft to do has so many applications where you can just speak to it in a conversational
549740	556260	tone and suddenly before you know it all of these triggers are set that can assist your day for
556260	560380	reminders for uh yes yes setting setting uh
560640	566220	tasks to do that you're most likely to forget so as a forgetful person that i am i should be
566220	570700	anyone wanting to ask a question to uh to ken
570700	576680	all right then i think people have noted down uh your 3 p.m
576680	579780	demonstrations so make sure to check it at the smart
579780	583340	stand excellent thank you guys thank you so much
583340	590340	all right so now we are moving to the
590640	598000	second one of our solution talks of this session this one coming from a little bit closer to to our
598000	604880	home these days and i'm delighted to introduce actually one of the partners of eit uh tomorrow
604880	610640	mobility event uh i'm talking about the planification manager at moventis nuria
610640	616640	gluminas
616640	618640	welcome
618640	620640	thank you
620640	628640	uh good morning uh first of all thank you very much for inviting us to this session
629440	636640	we're very proud to be here for those who don't know moventis moventis is moventia's business unit
636640	644640	dedicated to collective mobility this division brings together all the companies of the group
644640	650480	that develop their business through the transfer of passengers in buses in coaches
650640	659440	streetcars or other mortals transports like public rental bicycles or carpooling
659440	673440	moventis is focused on providing innovative solutions that contribute to get sustainable connected and safe mobility for all users
673440	680320	in 2017 moventis started to collaborate with the technological platform shuttle
680320	680340	in 2017 moventis started to collaborate with the technological platform shuttle
680640	684000	to implement a transport on demand line in the city of san cuvada
684000	685360	to implement a transport on demand line in the city of san cuvada
685360	689440	nowadays we are operating three transport and demand lines in this city
689440	696720	with shuttle's solution for the user this solution consists in an application
696720	704080	the user when wants to take a trip he makes the request through the application and it tells him
704080	710480	when the bus is going to pick him up i'll try to explain very briefly how artificial
710480	710560	i'll try to explain very briefly how artificial
710560	713040	intelligence has improved this platform
716320	719920	to create artificial intelligence we need algorithms and data
721120	728000	on the transport on demand case the algorithm must solve a problem called the dial or right problem
728560	735040	in this problem we have n requests k vehicles and some constraints like the capacity of the
735040	740320	vehicles or the hours of operation and the goal is to optimize the service
740960	744160	i i i don't think you can hope to get the correct answer
744160	746160	i i don't think you can hope to get the correct answer
746160	748160	it can be a little bit subjective depending on the operation
748640	752080	what does it mean optimizing the service well it can be a little bit subjective
752080	755600	depending on the operation to solve the problem we will use a realistic algorithm
756000	762720	and with these algorithms maybe we won't get an exact solution but we can get a
762720	769120	solution solution that it's pretty close to the exact one and the computational time is less than
769120	778480	algorithm that is an algorithm from 1959 if we have a lot of requests at the same
778480	784220	time with this algorithm that is very efficient we could take too long too
784220	789980	long to solve the problem that's why shuttle technicians decided to explore
789980	794980	other routing algorithms that would fit in the problem to compare the different
794980	799580	algorithms they studied the computational time required to solve the
799580	807940	problem and the efficiency respect the extra algorithm today the platform works with
807940	813160	four algorithms working in parallel and a timeout if the best algorithm gets a
813160	819200	solution before timeout the application will show these results but if the best
819200	824320	algorithm cannot get a solution before timeout then it will pass to the second
824980	831640	and so on to the fourth. another AI technique applied in shuttle is
831660	836720	clustering. when we talk about clustering we thought about grouping data in
836720	842960	clusters or groups trying to find characteristics that we wouldn't find
842960	850040	with our techniques. for example, shuttle has historical data of real trips where
850040	854520	they asked the users to score the satisfaction of the trip
854980	862660	The users have to score the global satisfaction, the waiting time satisfaction and the satisfaction
862660	864660	respect the delay.
864660	869760	When we say delay we mean the difference between the real drop of time and the expected drop
869760	870760	of time.
870760	877380	During this clustering we can see if each point is a trip, that there are three main
877380	879260	groups of trips.
879260	884580	The blue ones would be those where the user is more satisfied.
884580	891780	With the clustering we can find trip profiles and user profiles and this will help to personalize
891780	895160	the algorithm for each operation.
895160	899560	Because it's not the same taking the bus on a Monday when you have to go to work and you
899560	906820	need to be there at some hour or taking the bus on a Saturday afternoon when everything
906820	908220	is more relaxed.
908220	909220	So, that's it.
909220	915360	Another artificial intelligence technique applied is machine learning.
915360	921120	With all the historical data they train the machine so the machine can do predictions
921120	922900	on the demand.
922900	927540	With these predictions then the algorithm recalculates the time and gives a new expected
927540	931360	time that is more accurate than the first one.
931360	938540	So, if we come back to the day to day of Moventis we can see that the demand has been increasing.
938540	948220	So, we can say that artificial intelligence is now a reality in the transport sector.
948220	956200	With artificial intelligence we can provide a better service so we have happier users.
956200	962860	Thank you very much.
962860	966320	Thank you very much Nuria for this interesting presentation and this interesting example
966320	966680	actually pretty close from over here.
968540	974760	We still have a little bit of time for some questions.
974760	978300	If anybody would like to ask a question about Nuria's presentation?
978300	979300	Let me see.
979300	980300	Over here.
980300	986720	There is a microphone over there if you want to get this.
986720	988720	Thanks for breaking the ice.
988720	989720	Hi.
989720	990720	Hi.
990720	991720	I am from the Netherlands.
991720	993220	I am not really familiar with the on demand services like you are explaining.
993220	994220	So, how does that work if there are no passengers, there are no buses?
994220	995220	So, I have a question.
995220	996220	I am from the Netherlands.
996220	997220	I am not familiar with the on demand services like you are explaining.
997220	998220	So, how does that work?
998540	999540	So, there are no passengers.
999540	1000540	Just on the practical side.
1000540	1005540	If there are no passengers the bus is stopped and it is not running.
1005540	1006540	That's all.
1006540	1011540	Is there a minimum of people that have to make a demand?
1011540	1016540	The service is planned so the driver is prepared to do the service.
1016540	1023300	We have the driver, we have the bus and if there is no passenger the driver is like this.
1023300	1024300	Okay, perfect.
1024300	1025300	Thank you.
1025300	1027300	Thank you very much for the question.
1027300	1028300	Thanks for another question.
1028300	1035300	There is another one over here.
1035300	1036300	Hi everyone.
1036300	1039300	Thank you very much for the presentation.
1039300	1043300	So, my question is about when does it make sense to implement demand transport and what
1043300	1050300	kind of situation, what kind of values within the city or the rural realm and also how to
1050300	1053300	deploy a system from the beginning.
1053300	1054300	Thank you.
1054300	1055300	Well, usually we implement this kind of lines.
1055300	1056300	So, what do we do?
1056300	1064100	kind of lines in cities places with a low density where having a regular line
1064100	1073940	would be not efficient if I'm having passengers that in peak hour we know
1073940	1079540	that we can give the service with the demand bus
1079540	1088760	thank you any final question please I can come on to the microphone thank you
1091120	1094980	in the idea is that and if anybody would want to ask questions to stand on the
1094980	1097140	line
1101400	1106920	how much did you learn from other cities who tried similar approaches I know
1106920	1109460	Helsinki has something like this like maybe ten years ago
1109540	1114160	so how is this different or maybe just time you've changed so it's a better
1114160	1122260	situation now than it was before well probably all these platforms are yet
1122260	1127660	they were pretty similar way some years ago maybe 50 years ago we started trying
1127660	1133780	this kind of services with the typical series that the user had to call the day
1133780	1139520	before and had to say hey tomorrow I need the service now with all the
1139520	1148340	technology we can do it through this application and probably all the
1148340	1154700	people that is dedicated to study of this kind of algorithms are in contact with one
1154700	1161640	with other ones and they learn from one from one operation from from others
1163680	1167680	maybe since we still have one minute let's do it
1167680	1169360	I do have a final question
1169520	1171880	of the respect of the users because
1171880	1177660	anytime we encounter a new application a new app or new technology it's not always
1177660	1182600	easy to get people to use it yes how difficult or how easy maybe was it
1182600	1188880	for you for the users in Sankoogat to adopt the the usage of the shuttle
1188880	1196260	well we have the application and then there is a form for people that is not used to this kind of technology
1196260	1199220	at the beginning the percentage of people that was
1199520	1204520	requesting the service for the phone was around maybe 50%.
1204520	1209520	Nowadays, the percentage is around 8%.
1209520	1213520	So, every time we have more people using the application,
1213520	1216520	less people have to use it.
1216520	1222520	Very good. And then there's also people of certain ages
1222520	1225520	that don't necessarily understand the phone, but they can still call.
1225520	1228520	They can call, they can. Really interesting.
1228520	1231520	All right, Nuria, so thank you very much for being with us for the presentation
1231520	1234520	and for taking the time to answer our questions.
1234520	1236520	Thank you very much.
1239520	1243520	All right, so we saw two case studies, two examples,
1243520	1249520	on how different AI applications are being used in Dublin and in Barcelona.
1249520	1253520	Now it's time to discuss in more detail the innovations,
1253520	1257520	the implications, the policies needed, everything around
1257520	1258520	what do we do?
1258520	1262520	In terms of data and all other matters.
1262520	1267520	So stay tuned because in just a minute we're starting the panel discussion.
1288520	1291520	All right, and welcome back, everyone.
1291520	1294520	That was a short, that was a very short break.
1294520	1298520	Well, as mentioned, we're starting the second part of our session,
1298520	1303520	so welcome everyone who is joining us just now.
1303520	1307520	After these two examples that we've been seeing on the case of
1307520	1311520	different artificial intelligence usage in urban mobility,
1311520	1317520	we're going to be diving deep on many topics, I think, from the perspective of
1317520	1326520	mobility providers to public entities to how cities can better cooperate with innovators.
1326520	1330520	So I would like to invite my panelists to join me here on stage.
1330520	1332520	I will introduce them in just a second.
1347520	1357520	I guess you can stay here.
1357520	1358520	Excellent.
1358520	1363520	So thank you very much to all of you for having joined this panel discussion.
1363520	1370520	I think we have a great speaker lineup and I'm very excited to discuss in more detail
1370520	1372520	such a fascinating topic.
1372520	1376520	I mean, we have a cool room just in front of us.
1376520	1380520	Just next to me, I'm delighted to introduce the mobility innovation expert
1380520	1385520	coming all the way from London and the former head of innovation at Transport for London,
1385520	1386520	Mr. Rikesh Shah.
1386520	1389520	Thanks for being with us.
1389520	1392520	Also with us is Anne Irefusta Barrena.
1392520	1396520	She's a technology director for industry and mobility at Technalia.
1396520	1398520	Thank you for being with us.
1398520	1403520	On my other side, I'm delighted to introduce from the Frank Hofer Institute for Industrial Engineering,
1403520	1404520	Marco Amorim.
1404520	1405520	Hi.
1405520	1406520	Hi.
1406520	1412520	So with us is the CTO and Assistant City Manager at the City of Pinched Tree Corners in the
1412520	1414520	U.S., Brandon Branham.
1414520	1419520	So I would like to start with you, Rikesh Shah.
1419520	1426520	When we talk about such a global metropolis, such a global city like London, what are the
1426520	1431520	opportunities that AEI has brought for its mobility network?
1431520	1433520	What can you tell us about that?
1433520	1434520	Thank you.
1434520	1435520	Can you hear me okay?
1435520	1436520	Yeah.
1436520	1437520	So I think the role of AEI is a new thing.
1437520	1438520	You know, AEI has been around a long time, since the 1950s.
1438520	1439520	And I just go to what Ken said earlier, it's really relevant, is when I wake up in the
1439520	1440520	morning, I might check my diary or I might then check the news, which is based on what
1440520	1441520	I want to read.
1441520	1442520	I might then do my journey planning.
1442520	1443520	So if I do my journey planning, people like TFL are releasing the data.
1443520	1444520	We release hundreds of data sets.
1444520	1445520	There are over 700 apps in London that are powered by TFL data.
1445520	1446520	And that's based on the data that we have.
1446520	1447520	So if I do my journey planning, people like TFL are releasing the data.
1447520	1448520	We release hundreds of data sets.
1448520	1449520	There are over 700 apps in London that are powered by TFL data.
1449520	1450520	And that's based on the data that we have.
1450520	1467080	And that's based on my preference, 42% of Londoners use an app that's relevant to them.
1467080	1472640	So that's a form of AI.
1472640	1475520	Then if I get onto the road, the traffic's optimized.
1475520	1479080	The traffic's optimized based on the traffic lights and how you work.
1479080	1480080	The city wants to control the traffic.
1480080	1480500	So what can I do?
1480520	1484200	Then there might be a road safety element.
1484200	1489080	So it could be a case of what data is coming out of the cars, what data is coming out of
1489080	1490080	the vehicles.
1490080	1493080	So actually the opportunities have been there for a long time.
1493080	1495860	And the opportunities will continue to be there going forward.
1495860	1498780	I think where we need to be clear is what are the problems that we're trying to solve
1498780	1501960	for our cities in the short, medium and long term.
1501960	1502960	And then what outcomes do you want?
1502960	1506220	And if we don't get that right, it just becomes a technology thing.
1506220	1510240	So we've got to contextualise everything really well, which I'm sure we're doing well today.
1510240	1511240	Contextualising, indeed.
1511240	1517480	And I think already we've got some hints on really how do we put the needs of our passengers,
1517480	1518480	of our users first.
1518480	1522480	And we're going to be getting back to it very shortly, indeed.
1522480	1526100	Then I'd like to turn to Brandon Brown.
1526100	1530660	So the city of page three corners, it would be great if first of all, you can also put
1530660	1532740	us on the map.
1532740	1537300	I think that no one better to introduce us than you.
1537300	1540220	And how is it implementing AI in a smart city?
1540220	1544460	Thank you for those in the room.
1544460	1549120	We are just north of Atlanta, so 20 minutes from downtown Atlanta.
1549120	1552860	We like to say Atlanta is a suburb of Peachtree Corners.
1552860	1557720	But what we're seeing, obviously, in the metropolitan area, and Kim hit it on earlier, is traffic
1557720	1558720	is a major concern.
1558720	1561940	As we all know, the US is very car centric.
1561940	1565680	So how do we take use of the infrastructure to start to improve that?
1565680	1569460	We have a corridor that cuts through the heart of our city that carries 60,000 cars a day.
1569460	1573700	Right through the middle of our downtown area.
1573700	1578140	And so we're starting to do those things in traffic using the sensor sets that are on
1578140	1579140	there.
1579140	1582140	But then we decided to introduce an autonomous shuttle.
1582140	1585300	So how does that start to interact with the infrastructure?
1585300	1591600	So we use the AI sets that are on the sensor stack in the shuttle to communicate with our
1591600	1592600	infrastructure.
1592600	1597700	So we start to do preemption of traffic signals through that, and trying to find ways, because
1597700	1598700	in the US, public transportation is a major concern.
1598700	1607380	So how do we start to make it a viable option using AI in transportation and transportation
1607380	1608380	infrastructure?
1608380	1615380	Because I think how we're going to get there and the stuff that we're starting to do in
1615380	1616380	district orders.
1616380	1617380	So thank you.
1617380	1618380	Thank you very much.
1618380	1619380	I think, yeah, it's very, very interesting to see how different cities are implementing
1619380	1620380	solutions from all over the world.
1620380	1621380	So I would like then to turn to our next speaker, Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.
1621380	1622380	Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.
1622380	1623380	Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.
1623380	1624380	Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.
1624380	1625380	Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.
1625380	1626380	Anaida Fustavarena.
1626380	1627380	Anaida Fustavarena.
1627380	1628380	Anaida Fustavarena.
1628380	1629380	Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.
1629380	1630380	Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.
1630380	1631380	Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.
1631380	1639120	What are the AI solutions that you are looking into specifically and what do you think is
1639120	1640740	needed to scale them up?
1640740	1643740	Okay, thank you, Ana.
1643740	1647500	Thank you to Tomorrow Mobility for inviting us, Tecnalia, to reply to this relevant question
1647500	1650840	about upscaling solutions, AI solutions.
1650840	1658100	So we have seen two nice solutions in the first part of this session.
1658100	1667620	Well, I would first of all say that most AI developments remain as a proof of concept.
1668520	1671760	So it's difficult, they are tested offline,
1671760	1679760	and it's difficult to really have the whole life cycle for widespread errors
1680400	1684880	and for giving the necessary time to this whole life cycle
1684880	1689620	to really find or validate the solution.
1690020	1696220	So this life cycle needs to take into account ML, machine learning operations,
1696460	1698740	data operations, AI operations.
1698740	1703160	And so I think this is one of the most relevant aspects
1703160	1707480	that we need to take into account for upscaling AI solutions.
1707920	1714860	Then I think AI-based solutions must incorporate adequate management of the expectations
1714860	1714880	and the expectations of the AI.
1714880	1718780	So the steps must be incremental,
1719700	1727120	and an incremental roadmap, realistic, taking into account quick wins, must be applied.
1728000	1731260	Then access to skills, access to talent,
1731560	1737160	this is also something we need and it's relevant for the upscaling.
1738020	1742580	And the acceptance by professionals of a human-centered AI approach,
1742580	1744480	perhaps in the two nice solutions,
1744660	1744860	and one of the most important ones,
1744860	1749300	and at least that this is relevant and needs to take into account.
1749980	1754160	And then another clear aspect is the regulatory framework.
1755020	1759060	So this can be agreed at a global level.
1760340	1765960	These steps are taken to regulate the AI.
1766260	1770440	We have this sandbox on AI, the AI Act,
1770960	1773940	that will be defined and validated in two years' time.
1773940	1774640	So all of these steps are taken to regulate the AI.
1774640	1785620	So all this is needed, and I think these are, I would say, the most relevant aspects we need to take into account for the upscaling of AI solutions to the market.
1786520	1792660	Very interesting. You've put some important ingredients on the table. I've noted down the expectations, being realistic.
1793220	1797120	The access to skills and talent, when you were saying that, the room next to us was applauding.
1797320	1801120	So I think it probably resonated even in the other side of the room as well.
1801120	1807460	So these are all, I think, important questions that we will also take in the panel, indeed.
1807960	1815160	And then, last but not least, before I move, I open the debate, I would like to turn to Marco to tell us,
1815780	1821660	because you've been doing extensive research on how users perceive artificial intelligence.
1821920	1829040	So how would you assess it generally? The average user would perceive solutions of AI mobility.
1829040	1830500	What are their preferences?
1831120	1835600	What are the, I don't know, uncertainties or fears? What can you tell us?
1835600	1844500	Yeah, that's a good question, and quite a complex one, but so I will just point three main points that I think are quite interesting ones.
1844500	1845880	So the first one is habits.
1845880	1853220	So as humans, we are people of habits, so we like to stick to what we know, the way we do things.
1853220	1860960	So usually we don't like to go out of our comfort zone, and we have some studies, for example, that shows that cities,
1860960	1866600	where there have been pilots for automated vehicles, shuttles, or normal vehicles,
1867080	1872340	people usually are more willing to accept those technologies in the future.
1872800	1876020	So this is something that can prove this fact of the habits.
1876500	1878200	The next part is trust.
1878740	1883920	So we need to trust these new technologies or new service.
1885500	1889300	And for that, there is always a question.
1890000	1890920	Is this service reliable?
1890960	1892220	I mean, I never used it.
1892240	1893000	Will it work?
1893000	1893900	Will it not work?
1895100	1896700	And for example, there.

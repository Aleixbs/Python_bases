00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
We will give you money. Fantastic. I will open up my AI calendar or my AI application

00:08.320 --> 00:16.120
and I will simply tell it in very simple terms. There is an application due with the city of

00:16.120 --> 00:24.040
Costa Brava in Portugal on the 27th of November. I would like you to remind me two weeks in advance

00:24.040 --> 00:30.700
to send my proposal to my suppliers, ensure that the costs are all okay, and one week in advance

00:30.700 --> 00:39.200
set a reminder to discuss with my team our proposal. And like magic, AI creates all of those

00:39.200 --> 00:47.900
meeting requests, all of the calendar information, everything. And it's more like an

00:47.900 --> 00:53.680
intelligent assistant. So if I can transfer that now maybe to a city application,

00:54.040 --> 00:59.820
we are from Dublin. Our company will install a lot of the traffic signals and coordinated controls.

01:00.400 --> 01:06.500
We believe in the future at some point, AI will be introduced in such a way that we can tell us

01:06.500 --> 01:12.520
on Saturdays, our biggest football team, Dublin, play at the major stadium.

01:13.620 --> 01:18.300
Here is a list of all the fixtures and all of the times the matches will take place.

01:18.900 --> 01:24.020
We know we can coordinate with the traffic signals because it's an adaptive traffic control system.

01:24.040 --> 01:29.940
I'm sure something you are all familiar with. It uses already a primitive form of AI to detect

01:29.940 --> 01:35.540
traffic jams and change the light sequences. But what if we were able to use AI to tell us

01:35.540 --> 01:42.240
for half an hour or an hour before the match, give all the routes towards the stadium,

01:42.580 --> 01:49.140
extended green time access, and after the match, if the team win, change all the lights to blue.

01:49.260 --> 01:53.860
No, I'm joking. We won't do that. But there are so many ways we could,

01:54.040 --> 02:00.660
but we can't use it. Our company was started about 20 years ago. Traditionally was a maintenance

02:00.660 --> 02:05.620
company, but we decided we wanted to be the best smart cities provider in Ireland.

02:06.020 --> 02:12.800
So we established two sub companies within ours, which is for software development and traffic

02:12.800 --> 02:19.560
installations. That means we have our own team on the ground, able to install lights, sensors,

02:19.560 --> 02:23.940
any type of application, and our own software engineers,

02:24.040 --> 02:30.100
to create all of the AI, the backend, and the machine learning that's required to provide the

02:30.100 --> 02:37.700
best AI for Dublin. One of our most interesting pilot projects at the moment is done in

02:37.700 --> 02:43.580
coordination with partners in the UK and around. And it's a huge problem in cities where you have

02:43.580 --> 02:50.580
tram intersections with vehicles. A vehicle approaches a red light at high speed, and you

02:50.580 --> 02:53.900
know instantly they are not going to be able to brake in time.

02:54.040 --> 02:58.840
So we decided to make the red light. Nine times out of 10, the driver carries through the red light

02:58.840 --> 03:05.080
and crashes straight into the tram. This can cause problems, obviously, for losing a public transport

03:05.080 --> 03:09.880
vehicle for a certain amount of time while it's under repair, and then also the devastation it'll

03:09.880 --> 03:16.120
cause the passengers and the cars. Our pilot program at the moment, instead of trying to stop

03:16.120 --> 03:23.980
the car, it can read the speed of the approaching vehicle, make an assisted, educated decision that

03:23.980 --> 03:31.980
this car will not stop in time for the red light, and instead it will stop the tram. It'll remove any

03:31.980 --> 03:38.060
possibility for the public vehicle to cross the path of the speeding car. Now if we were to try

03:38.060 --> 03:43.340
and introduce that based on people, it would be impossible. You would need one person per

03:43.340 --> 03:49.580
intersection 24 hours a day to watch it. However, one AI system could watch over every single

03:49.580 --> 03:53.500
junction that has a sensor that is monitoring all this data.

03:53.980 --> 03:59.980
Which brings me to my real point. The ability for us to introduce AI and systems like this in

03:59.980 --> 04:05.520
the future comes down to sensors. It comes down to the quality of the data that we are able to

04:05.520 --> 04:12.340
collect in real time and bring on our cities. Really, we know AI won't really impact our lives.

04:12.540 --> 04:18.160
We have a lovely saying in Ireland and Europe that a society grows stronger when its residents

04:18.160 --> 04:23.660
plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. And this is what it's about. It is our

04:23.660 --> 04:23.960
job to make sure that we have the data that we need to make sure that we have the data that we

04:23.960 --> 04:30.440
need to put in the sensors so that the next generation can create life-changing AI applications.

04:31.480 --> 04:37.480
We have made a small sensor for one of my most favourite projects that we have at the moment.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.760
There's a lot of drownings in Ireland and it's unfortunate because we are surrounded

04:42.760 --> 04:48.440
by so much water. And the lunch boys that are used to save someone who is drowning

04:48.440 --> 04:53.640
regularly go missing, being stag dudes, being people using them. At the moment they are not

04:53.640 --> 04:59.320
intelligent devices. A ring boy is lifted, it is thrown in the water to save someone and it is gone.

05:00.040 --> 05:06.600
We developed a small sensor that sits at the bottom of the ring boy housing. It tells the

05:06.600 --> 05:11.800
council when there is a life boy sensor present, but more importantly when there is not.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.640
This then triggers the council to go out and replace the life boy.

05:17.640 --> 05:23.320
They are not at a great cost, but what happens is it saves a life by ensuring there is

05:23.320 --> 05:29.640
constantly a ring boy at the location a person needs there to be. But as we start to introduce

05:29.640 --> 05:35.400
AI in the future, and again with our partners in the UK we are discovering this, if we develop that

05:35.400 --> 05:41.560
sensor to a point where we know that it is being used or it can prove that the ring boy is being

05:41.560 --> 05:48.840
used in an emergency situation and someone's life is in danger, that exact same trigger can be used

05:48.840 --> 05:53.240
to send out drones to find where the person is in the water. It can be used to find where the person is in the water.

05:53.720 --> 06:00.280
I give an exact GPS location. If the drone then confirms someone is drowning, it can trigger the

06:00.280 --> 06:06.920
emergency response to the location to make sure that person is saved in time at the exact location

06:06.920 --> 06:14.360
where they are in peril. It's a fantastic opportunity to utilize all of the technologies

06:14.360 --> 06:19.640
that are available to us and we are very excited to keep developing this sensor and more.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.160
If you are interested, we will be doing a demonstration

06:23.320 --> 06:31.720
of this full system. Neil might have to tell me the exact location. It's the Smart Dublin stand

06:31.720 --> 06:37.560
at three o'clock today. We have designed all of the software, all of the hardware,

06:37.560 --> 06:42.440
and currently there are 600 of these sensors installed around Ireland at the moment.

06:49.720 --> 06:53.240
I don't have a huge amount of time left, but I would like to thank

06:53.320 --> 06:59.640
you for your participation and listening as cleanly as you have. As I said, Neil and I will

06:59.640 --> 07:04.600
be on the Smart Dublin stand for most of the day. We can take you through all of our other

07:05.160 --> 07:11.240
applications of AI that we are using, but we firmly believe that this is the future

07:11.240 --> 07:18.120
of smart cities and the sooner we can start to see it as an assisted intelligence instead

07:18.120 --> 07:22.680
of an artificial intelligence, the better all of our cities and public spaces will be.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.560
Thank you for your time. Welcome any questions.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.760
Give it up to Gengover, everyone.

07:32.520 --> 07:38.040
All right. Well, thank you very much for this very interesting presentation and how we are putting

07:38.040 --> 07:45.640
safety of our users first. Now, we still have maybe just about five minutes in case anybody

07:45.640 --> 07:51.880
would want to ask a question. We have the microphone here in the front, so don't be shy.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.000
Come over and ask a question.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.320
It's always hard to speak the first. Nobody wants to speak at the start.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.520
Who wants to break the ice?

08:01.320 --> 08:05.480
Anyone? Then Ken, in the meantime, because we discussed that

08:06.360 --> 08:12.440
before, the other day in our call. How much do you use AI in your day-to-day life? How many

08:12.440 --> 08:13.320
times do you use it per day?

08:14.920 --> 08:20.280
No, I do. I use it a lot. I gave the example at the start of using it to control my calendar,

08:20.280 --> 08:23.320
using it as an assistant to set reminders. I'm an assistant to a standard system, which I'm an

08:23.320 --> 08:28.920
extremely forgetful i'm sure some of you are fantastic at making notes at conferences and

08:28.920 --> 08:35.100
putting them into your calendar and all that but it is almost impossible for me i tend to

08:35.100 --> 08:40.260
months after the event find a scrambled up piece of paper at the bottom of my bag and go oh they

08:40.260 --> 08:45.280
were the notes i took on the day whereas now with ai technologies and it's as simple as the

08:45.280 --> 08:50.640
microsoft applications yesterday microsoft were on stage with open ai talking about their

08:50.640 --> 08:56.300
partnership they had their developer conference and most of the applications for ai are already

08:56.300 --> 09:02.360
in your computer it's not something you have to download or sign up to chat gbt for turbo

09:02.360 --> 09:09.740
even microsoft to do has so many applications where you can just speak to it in a conversational

09:09.740 --> 09:16.260
tone and suddenly before you know it all of these triggers are set that can assist your day for

09:16.260 --> 09:20.380
reminders for uh yes yes setting setting uh

09:20.640 --> 09:26.220
tasks to do that you're most likely to forget so as a forgetful person that i am i should be

09:26.220 --> 09:30.700
anyone wanting to ask a question to uh to ken

09:30.700 --> 09:36.680
all right then i think people have noted down uh your 3 p.m

09:36.680 --> 09:39.780
demonstrations so make sure to check it at the smart

09:39.780 --> 09:43.340
stand excellent thank you guys thank you so much

09:43.340 --> 09:50.340
all right so now we are moving to the

09:50.640 --> 09:58.000
second one of our solution talks of this session this one coming from a little bit closer to to our

09:58.000 --> 10:04.880
home these days and i'm delighted to introduce actually one of the partners of eit uh tomorrow

10:04.880 --> 10:10.640
mobility event uh i'm talking about the planification manager at moventis nuria

10:10.640 --> 10:16.640
gluminas

10:16.640 --> 10:18.640
welcome

10:18.640 --> 10:20.640
thank you

10:20.640 --> 10:28.640
uh good morning uh first of all thank you very much for inviting us to this session

10:29.440 --> 10:36.640
we're very proud to be here for those who don't know moventis moventis is moventia's business unit

10:36.640 --> 10:44.640
dedicated to collective mobility this division brings together all the companies of the group

10:44.640 --> 10:50.480
that develop their business through the transfer of passengers in buses in coaches

10:50.640 --> 10:59.440
streetcars or other mortals transports like public rental bicycles or carpooling

10:59.440 --> 11:13.440
moventis is focused on providing innovative solutions that contribute to get sustainable connected and safe mobility for all users

11:13.440 --> 11:20.320
in 2017 moventis started to collaborate with the technological platform shuttle

11:20.320 --> 11:20.340
in 2017 moventis started to collaborate with the technological platform shuttle

11:20.640 --> 11:24.000
to implement a transport on demand line in the city of san cuvada

11:24.000 --> 11:25.360
to implement a transport on demand line in the city of san cuvada

11:25.360 --> 11:29.440
nowadays we are operating three transport and demand lines in this city

11:29.440 --> 11:36.720
with shuttle's solution for the user this solution consists in an application

11:36.720 --> 11:44.080
the user when wants to take a trip he makes the request through the application and it tells him

11:44.080 --> 11:50.480
when the bus is going to pick him up i'll try to explain very briefly how artificial

11:50.480 --> 11:50.560
i'll try to explain very briefly how artificial

11:50.560 --> 11:53.040
intelligence has improved this platform

11:56.320 --> 11:59.920
to create artificial intelligence we need algorithms and data

12:01.120 --> 12:08.000
on the transport on demand case the algorithm must solve a problem called the dial or right problem

12:08.560 --> 12:15.040
in this problem we have n requests k vehicles and some constraints like the capacity of the

12:15.040 --> 12:20.320
vehicles or the hours of operation and the goal is to optimize the service

12:20.960 --> 12:24.160
i i i don't think you can hope to get the correct answer

12:24.160 --> 12:26.160
i i don't think you can hope to get the correct answer

12:26.160 --> 12:28.160
it can be a little bit subjective depending on the operation

12:28.640 --> 12:32.080
what does it mean optimizing the service well it can be a little bit subjective

12:32.080 --> 12:35.600
depending on the operation to solve the problem we will use a realistic algorithm

12:36.000 --> 12:42.720
and with these algorithms maybe we won't get an exact solution but we can get a

12:42.720 --> 12:49.120
solution solution that it's pretty close to the exact one and the computational time is less than

12:49.120 --> 12:58.480
algorithm that is an algorithm from 1959 if we have a lot of requests at the same

12:58.480 --> 13:04.220
time with this algorithm that is very efficient we could take too long too

13:04.220 --> 13:09.980
long to solve the problem that's why shuttle technicians decided to explore

13:09.980 --> 13:14.980
other routing algorithms that would fit in the problem to compare the different

13:14.980 --> 13:19.580
algorithms they studied the computational time required to solve the

13:19.580 --> 13:27.940
problem and the efficiency respect the extra algorithm today the platform works with

13:27.940 --> 13:33.160
four algorithms working in parallel and a timeout if the best algorithm gets a

13:33.160 --> 13:39.200
solution before timeout the application will show these results but if the best

13:39.200 --> 13:44.320
algorithm cannot get a solution before timeout then it will pass to the second

13:44.980 --> 13:51.640
and so on to the fourth. another AI technique applied in shuttle is

13:51.660 --> 13:56.720
clustering. when we talk about clustering we thought about grouping data in

13:56.720 --> 14:02.960
clusters or groups trying to find characteristics that we wouldn't find

14:02.960 --> 14:10.040
with our techniques. for example, shuttle has historical data of real trips where

14:10.040 --> 14:14.520
they asked the users to score the satisfaction of the trip

14:14.980 --> 14:22.660
The users have to score the global satisfaction, the waiting time satisfaction and the satisfaction

14:22.660 --> 14:24.660
respect the delay.

14:24.660 --> 14:29.760
When we say delay we mean the difference between the real drop of time and the expected drop

14:29.760 --> 14:30.760
of time.

14:30.760 --> 14:37.380
During this clustering we can see if each point is a trip, that there are three main

14:37.380 --> 14:39.260
groups of trips.

14:39.260 --> 14:44.580
The blue ones would be those where the user is more satisfied.

14:44.580 --> 14:51.780
With the clustering we can find trip profiles and user profiles and this will help to personalize

14:51.780 --> 14:55.160
the algorithm for each operation.

14:55.160 --> 14:59.560
Because it's not the same taking the bus on a Monday when you have to go to work and you

14:59.560 --> 15:06.820
need to be there at some hour or taking the bus on a Saturday afternoon when everything

15:06.820 --> 15:08.220
is more relaxed.

15:08.220 --> 15:09.220
So, that's it.

15:09.220 --> 15:15.360
Another artificial intelligence technique applied is machine learning.

15:15.360 --> 15:21.120
With all the historical data they train the machine so the machine can do predictions

15:21.120 --> 15:22.900
on the demand.

15:22.900 --> 15:27.540
With these predictions then the algorithm recalculates the time and gives a new expected

15:27.540 --> 15:31.360
time that is more accurate than the first one.

15:31.360 --> 15:38.540
So, if we come back to the day to day of Moventis we can see that the demand has been increasing.

15:38.540 --> 15:48.220
So, we can say that artificial intelligence is now a reality in the transport sector.

15:48.220 --> 15:56.200
With artificial intelligence we can provide a better service so we have happier users.

15:56.200 --> 16:02.860
Thank you very much.

16:02.860 --> 16:06.320
Thank you very much Nuria for this interesting presentation and this interesting example

16:06.320 --> 16:06.680
actually pretty close from over here.

16:08.540 --> 16:14.760
We still have a little bit of time for some questions.

16:14.760 --> 16:18.300
If anybody would like to ask a question about Nuria's presentation?

16:18.300 --> 16:19.300
Let me see.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.300
Over here.

16:20.300 --> 16:26.720
There is a microphone over there if you want to get this.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.720
Thanks for breaking the ice.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.720
Hi.

16:29.720 --> 16:30.720
Hi.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.720
I am from the Netherlands.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.220
I am not really familiar with the on demand services like you are explaining.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.220
So, how does that work if there are no passengers, there are no buses?

16:34.220 --> 16:35.220
So, I have a question.

16:35.220 --> 16:36.220
I am from the Netherlands.

16:36.220 --> 16:37.220
I am not familiar with the on demand services like you are explaining.

16:37.220 --> 16:38.220
So, how does that work?

16:38.540 --> 16:39.540
So, there are no passengers.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.540
Just on the practical side.

16:40.540 --> 16:45.540
If there are no passengers the bus is stopped and it is not running.

16:45.540 --> 16:46.540
That's all.

16:46.540 --> 16:51.540
Is there a minimum of people that have to make a demand?

16:51.540 --> 16:56.540
The service is planned so the driver is prepared to do the service.

16:56.540 --> 17:03.300
We have the driver, we have the bus and if there is no passenger the driver is like this.

17:03.300 --> 17:04.300
Okay, perfect.

17:04.300 --> 17:05.300
Thank you.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.300
Thank you very much for the question.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.300
Thanks for another question.

17:08.300 --> 17:15.300
There is another one over here.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.300
Hi everyone.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.300
Thank you very much for the presentation.

17:19.300 --> 17:23.300
So, my question is about when does it make sense to implement demand transport and what

17:23.300 --> 17:30.300
kind of situation, what kind of values within the city or the rural realm and also how to

17:30.300 --> 17:33.300
deploy a system from the beginning.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.300
Thank you.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.300
Well, usually we implement this kind of lines.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.300
So, what do we do?

17:36.300 --> 17:44.100
kind of lines in cities places with a low density where having a regular line

17:44.100 --> 17:53.940
would be not efficient if I'm having passengers that in peak hour we know

17:53.940 --> 17:59.540
that we can give the service with the demand bus

17:59.540 --> 18:08.760
thank you any final question please I can come on to the microphone thank you

18:11.120 --> 18:14.980
in the idea is that and if anybody would want to ask questions to stand on the

18:14.980 --> 18:17.140
line

18:21.400 --> 18:26.920
how much did you learn from other cities who tried similar approaches I know

18:26.920 --> 18:29.460
Helsinki has something like this like maybe ten years ago

18:29.540 --> 18:34.160
so how is this different or maybe just time you've changed so it's a better

18:34.160 --> 18:42.260
situation now than it was before well probably all these platforms are yet

18:42.260 --> 18:47.660
they were pretty similar way some years ago maybe 50 years ago we started trying

18:47.660 --> 18:53.780
this kind of services with the typical series that the user had to call the day

18:53.780 --> 18:59.520
before and had to say hey tomorrow I need the service now with all the

18:59.520 --> 19:08.340
technology we can do it through this application and probably all the

19:08.340 --> 19:14.700
people that is dedicated to study of this kind of algorithms are in contact with one

19:14.700 --> 19:21.640
with other ones and they learn from one from one operation from from others

19:23.680 --> 19:27.680
maybe since we still have one minute let's do it

19:27.680 --> 19:29.360
I do have a final question

19:29.520 --> 19:31.880
of the respect of the users because

19:31.880 --> 19:37.660
anytime we encounter a new application a new app or new technology it's not always

19:37.660 --> 19:42.600
easy to get people to use it yes how difficult or how easy maybe was it

19:42.600 --> 19:48.880
for you for the users in Sankoogat to adopt the the usage of the shuttle

19:48.880 --> 19:56.260
well we have the application and then there is a form for people that is not used to this kind of technology

19:56.260 --> 19:59.220
at the beginning the percentage of people that was

19:59.520 --> 20:04.520
requesting the service for the phone was around maybe 50%.

20:04.520 --> 20:09.520
Nowadays, the percentage is around 8%.

20:09.520 --> 20:13.520
So, every time we have more people using the application,

20:13.520 --> 20:16.520
less people have to use it.

20:16.520 --> 20:22.520
Very good. And then there's also people of certain ages

20:22.520 --> 20:25.520
that don't necessarily understand the phone, but they can still call.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.520
They can call, they can. Really interesting.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.520
All right, Nuria, so thank you very much for being with us for the presentation

20:31.520 --> 20:34.520
and for taking the time to answer our questions.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.520
Thank you very much.

20:39.520 --> 20:43.520
All right, so we saw two case studies, two examples,

20:43.520 --> 20:49.520
on how different AI applications are being used in Dublin and in Barcelona.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.520
Now it's time to discuss in more detail the innovations,

20:53.520 --> 20:57.520
the implications, the policies needed, everything around

20:57.520 --> 20:58.520
what do we do?

20:58.520 --> 21:02.520
In terms of data and all other matters.

21:02.520 --> 21:07.520
So stay tuned because in just a minute we're starting the panel discussion.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.520
All right, and welcome back, everyone.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.520
That was a short, that was a very short break.

21:34.520 --> 21:38.520
Well, as mentioned, we're starting the second part of our session,

21:38.520 --> 21:43.520
so welcome everyone who is joining us just now.

21:43.520 --> 21:47.520
After these two examples that we've been seeing on the case of

21:47.520 --> 21:51.520
different artificial intelligence usage in urban mobility,

21:51.520 --> 21:57.520
we're going to be diving deep on many topics, I think, from the perspective of

21:57.520 --> 22:06.520
mobility providers to public entities to how cities can better cooperate with innovators.

22:06.520 --> 22:10.520
So I would like to invite my panelists to join me here on stage.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.520
I will introduce them in just a second.

22:27.520 --> 22:37.520
I guess you can stay here.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.520
Excellent.

22:38.520 --> 22:43.520
So thank you very much to all of you for having joined this panel discussion.

22:43.520 --> 22:50.520
I think we have a great speaker lineup and I'm very excited to discuss in more detail

22:50.520 --> 22:52.520
such a fascinating topic.

22:52.520 --> 22:56.520
I mean, we have a cool room just in front of us.

22:56.520 --> 23:00.520
Just next to me, I'm delighted to introduce the mobility innovation expert

23:00.520 --> 23:05.520
coming all the way from London and the former head of innovation at Transport for London,

23:05.520 --> 23:06.520
Mr. Rikesh Shah.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.520
Thanks for being with us.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.520
Also with us is Anne Irefusta Barrena.

23:12.520 --> 23:16.520
She's a technology director for industry and mobility at Technalia.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.520
Thank you for being with us.

23:18.520 --> 23:23.520
On my other side, I'm delighted to introduce from the Frank Hofer Institute for Industrial Engineering,

23:23.520 --> 23:24.520
Marco Amorim.

23:24.520 --> 23:25.520
Hi.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.520
Hi.

23:26.520 --> 23:32.520
So with us is the CTO and Assistant City Manager at the City of Pinched Tree Corners in the

23:32.520 --> 23:34.520
U.S., Brandon Branham.

23:34.520 --> 23:39.520
So I would like to start with you, Rikesh Shah.

23:39.520 --> 23:46.520
When we talk about such a global metropolis, such a global city like London, what are the

23:46.520 --> 23:51.520
opportunities that AEI has brought for its mobility network?

23:51.520 --> 23:53.520
What can you tell us about that?

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
Thank you.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.520
Can you hear me okay?

23:55.520 --> 23:56.520
Yeah.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.520
So I think the role of AEI is a new thing.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.520
You know, AEI has been around a long time, since the 1950s.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.520
And I just go to what Ken said earlier, it's really relevant, is when I wake up in the

23:59.520 --> 24:00.520
morning, I might check my diary or I might then check the news, which is based on what

24:00.520 --> 24:01.520
I want to read.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.520
I might then do my journey planning.

24:02.520 --> 24:03.520
So if I do my journey planning, people like TFL are releasing the data.

24:03.520 --> 24:04.520
We release hundreds of data sets.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.520
There are over 700 apps in London that are powered by TFL data.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.520
And that's based on the data that we have.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.520
So if I do my journey planning, people like TFL are releasing the data.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.520
We release hundreds of data sets.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.520
There are over 700 apps in London that are powered by TFL data.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.520
And that's based on the data that we have.

24:10.520 --> 24:27.080
And that's based on my preference, 42% of Londoners use an app that's relevant to them.

24:27.080 --> 24:32.640
So that's a form of AI.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.520
Then if I get onto the road, the traffic's optimized.

24:35.520 --> 24:39.080
The traffic's optimized based on the traffic lights and how you work.

24:39.080 --> 24:40.080
The city wants to control the traffic.

24:40.080 --> 24:40.500
So what can I do?

24:40.520 --> 24:44.200
Then there might be a road safety element.

24:44.200 --> 24:49.080
So it could be a case of what data is coming out of the cars, what data is coming out of

24:49.080 --> 24:50.080
the vehicles.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.080
So actually the opportunities have been there for a long time.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.860
And the opportunities will continue to be there going forward.

24:55.860 --> 24:58.780
I think where we need to be clear is what are the problems that we're trying to solve

24:58.780 --> 25:01.960
for our cities in the short, medium and long term.

25:01.960 --> 25:02.960
And then what outcomes do you want?

25:02.960 --> 25:06.220
And if we don't get that right, it just becomes a technology thing.

25:06.220 --> 25:10.240
So we've got to contextualise everything really well, which I'm sure we're doing well today.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.240
Contextualising, indeed.

25:11.240 --> 25:17.480
And I think already we've got some hints on really how do we put the needs of our passengers,

25:17.480 --> 25:18.480
of our users first.

25:18.480 --> 25:22.480
And we're going to be getting back to it very shortly, indeed.

25:22.480 --> 25:26.100
Then I'd like to turn to Brandon Brown.

25:26.100 --> 25:30.660
So the city of page three corners, it would be great if first of all, you can also put

25:30.660 --> 25:32.740
us on the map.

25:32.740 --> 25:37.300
I think that no one better to introduce us than you.

25:37.300 --> 25:40.220
And how is it implementing AI in a smart city?

25:40.220 --> 25:44.460
Thank you for those in the room.

25:44.460 --> 25:49.120
We are just north of Atlanta, so 20 minutes from downtown Atlanta.

25:49.120 --> 25:52.860
We like to say Atlanta is a suburb of Peachtree Corners.

25:52.860 --> 25:57.720
But what we're seeing, obviously, in the metropolitan area, and Kim hit it on earlier, is traffic

25:57.720 --> 25:58.720
is a major concern.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.940
As we all know, the US is very car centric.

26:01.940 --> 26:05.680
So how do we take use of the infrastructure to start to improve that?

26:05.680 --> 26:09.460
We have a corridor that cuts through the heart of our city that carries 60,000 cars a day.

26:09.460 --> 26:13.700
Right through the middle of our downtown area.

26:13.700 --> 26:18.140
And so we're starting to do those things in traffic using the sensor sets that are on

26:18.140 --> 26:19.140
there.

26:19.140 --> 26:22.140
But then we decided to introduce an autonomous shuttle.

26:22.140 --> 26:25.300
So how does that start to interact with the infrastructure?

26:25.300 --> 26:31.600
So we use the AI sets that are on the sensor stack in the shuttle to communicate with our

26:31.600 --> 26:32.600
infrastructure.

26:32.600 --> 26:37.700
So we start to do preemption of traffic signals through that, and trying to find ways, because

26:37.700 --> 26:38.700
in the US, public transportation is a major concern.

26:38.700 --> 26:47.380
So how do we start to make it a viable option using AI in transportation and transportation

26:47.380 --> 26:48.380
infrastructure?

26:48.380 --> 26:55.380
Because I think how we're going to get there and the stuff that we're starting to do in

26:55.380 --> 26:56.380
district orders.

26:56.380 --> 26:57.380
So thank you.

26:57.380 --> 26:58.380
Thank you very much.

26:58.380 --> 26:59.380
I think, yeah, it's very, very interesting to see how different cities are implementing

26:59.380 --> 27:00.380
solutions from all over the world.

27:00.380 --> 27:01.380
So I would like then to turn to our next speaker, Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

27:01.380 --> 27:02.380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

27:02.380 --> 27:03.380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

27:03.380 --> 27:04.380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

27:04.380 --> 27:05.380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

27:05.380 --> 27:06.380
Anaida Fustavarena.

27:06.380 --> 27:07.380
Anaida Fustavarena.

27:07.380 --> 27:08.380
Anaida Fustavarena.

27:08.380 --> 27:09.380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

27:09.380 --> 27:10.380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

27:10.380 --> 27:11.380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

27:11.380 --> 27:19.120
What are the AI solutions that you are looking into specifically and what do you think is

27:19.120 --> 27:20.740
needed to scale them up?

27:20.740 --> 27:23.740
Okay, thank you, Ana.

27:23.740 --> 27:27.500
Thank you to Tomorrow Mobility for inviting us, Tecnalia, to reply to this relevant question

27:27.500 --> 27:30.840
about upscaling solutions, AI solutions.

27:30.840 --> 27:38.100
So we have seen two nice solutions in the first part of this session.

27:38.100 --> 27:47.620
Well, I would first of all say that most AI developments remain as a proof of concept.

27:48.520 --> 27:51.760
So it's difficult, they are tested offline,

27:51.760 --> 27:59.760
and it's difficult to really have the whole life cycle for widespread errors

28:00.400 --> 28:04.880
and for giving the necessary time to this whole life cycle

28:04.880 --> 28:09.620
to really find or validate the solution.

28:10.020 --> 28:16.220
So this life cycle needs to take into account ML, machine learning operations,

28:16.460 --> 28:18.740
data operations, AI operations.

28:18.740 --> 28:23.160
And so I think this is one of the most relevant aspects

28:23.160 --> 28:27.480
that we need to take into account for upscaling AI solutions.

28:27.920 --> 28:34.860
Then I think AI-based solutions must incorporate adequate management of the expectations

28:34.860 --> 28:34.880
and the expectations of the AI.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.780
So the steps must be incremental,

28:39.700 --> 28:47.120
and an incremental roadmap, realistic, taking into account quick wins, must be applied.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.260
Then access to skills, access to talent,

28:51.560 --> 28:57.160
this is also something we need and it's relevant for the upscaling.

28:58.020 --> 29:02.580
And the acceptance by professionals of a human-centered AI approach,

29:02.580 --> 29:04.480
perhaps in the two nice solutions,

29:04.660 --> 29:04.860
and one of the most important ones,

29:04.860 --> 29:09.300
and at least that this is relevant and needs to take into account.

29:09.980 --> 29:14.160
And then another clear aspect is the regulatory framework.

29:15.020 --> 29:19.060
So this can be agreed at a global level.

29:20.340 --> 29:25.960
These steps are taken to regulate the AI.

29:26.260 --> 29:30.440
We have this sandbox on AI, the AI Act,

29:30.960 --> 29:33.940
that will be defined and validated in two years' time.

29:33.940 --> 29:34.640
So all of these steps are taken to regulate the AI.

29:34.640 --> 29:45.620
So all this is needed, and I think these are, I would say, the most relevant aspects we need to take into account for the upscaling of AI solutions to the market.

29:46.520 --> 29:52.660
Very interesting. You've put some important ingredients on the table. I've noted down the expectations, being realistic.

29:53.220 --> 29:57.120
The access to skills and talent, when you were saying that, the room next to us was applauding.

29:57.320 --> 30:01.120
So I think it probably resonated even in the other side of the room as well.

30:01.120 --> 30:07.460
So these are all, I think, important questions that we will also take in the panel, indeed.

30:07.960 --> 30:15.160
And then, last but not least, before I move, I open the debate, I would like to turn to Marco to tell us,

30:15.780 --> 30:21.660
because you've been doing extensive research on how users perceive artificial intelligence.

30:21.920 --> 30:29.040
So how would you assess it generally? The average user would perceive solutions of AI mobility.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.500
What are their preferences?

30:31.120 --> 30:35.600
What are the, I don't know, uncertainties or fears? What can you tell us?

30:35.600 --> 30:44.500
Yeah, that's a good question, and quite a complex one, but so I will just point three main points that I think are quite interesting ones.

30:44.500 --> 30:45.880
So the first one is habits.

30:45.880 --> 30:53.220
So as humans, we are people of habits, so we like to stick to what we know, the way we do things.

30:53.220 --> 31:00.960
So usually we don't like to go out of our comfort zone, and we have some studies, for example, that shows that cities,

31:00.960 --> 31:06.600
where there have been pilots for automated vehicles, shuttles, or normal vehicles,

31:07.080 --> 31:12.340
people usually are more willing to accept those technologies in the future.

31:12.800 --> 31:16.020
So this is something that can prove this fact of the habits.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.200
The next part is trust.

31:18.740 --> 31:23.920
So we need to trust these new technologies or new service.

31:25.500 --> 31:29.300
And for that, there is always a question.

31:30.000 --> 31:30.920
Is this service reliable?

31:30.960 --> 31:32.220
I mean, I never used it.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.000
Will it work?

31:33.000 --> 31:33.900
Will it not work?

31:35.100 --> 31:36.700
And for example, there.

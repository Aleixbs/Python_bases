1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
We will give you money. Fantastic. I will open up my AI calendar or my AI application

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,120
and I will simply tell it in very simple terms. There is an application due with the city of

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:24,040
Costa Brava in Portugal on the 27th of November. I would like you to remind me two weeks in advance

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,700
to send my proposal to my suppliers, ensure that the costs are all okay, and one week in advance

5
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:39,200
set a reminder to discuss with my team our proposal. And like magic, AI creates all of those

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:47,900
meeting requests, all of the calendar information, everything. And it's more like an

7
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,680
intelligent assistant. So if I can transfer that now maybe to a city application,

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,820
we are from Dublin. Our company will install a lot of the traffic signals and coordinated controls.

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,500
We believe in the future at some point, AI will be introduced in such a way that we can tell us

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,520
on Saturdays, our biggest football team, Dublin, play at the major stadium.

11
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,300
Here is a list of all the fixtures and all of the times the matches will take place.

12
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,020
We know we can coordinate with the traffic signals because it's an adaptive traffic control system.

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,940
I'm sure something you are all familiar with. It uses already a primitive form of AI to detect

14
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,540
traffic jams and change the light sequences. But what if we were able to use AI to tell us

15
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:42,240
for half an hour or an hour before the match, give all the routes towards the stadium,

16
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:49,140
extended green time access, and after the match, if the team win, change all the lights to blue.

17
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,860
No, I'm joking. We won't do that. But there are so many ways we could,

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,660
but we can't use it. Our company was started about 20 years ago. Traditionally was a maintenance

19
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,620
company, but we decided we wanted to be the best smart cities provider in Ireland.

20
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,800
So we established two sub companies within ours, which is for software development and traffic

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,560
installations. That means we have our own team on the ground, able to install lights, sensors,

22
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,940
any type of application, and our own software engineers,

23
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,100
to create all of the AI, the backend, and the machine learning that's required to provide the

24
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:37,700
best AI for Dublin. One of our most interesting pilot projects at the moment is done in

25
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,580
coordination with partners in the UK and around. And it's a huge problem in cities where you have

26
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:50,580
tram intersections with vehicles. A vehicle approaches a red light at high speed, and you

27
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,900
know instantly they are not going to be able to brake in time.

28
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,840
So we decided to make the red light. Nine times out of 10, the driver carries through the red light

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,080
and crashes straight into the tram. This can cause problems, obviously, for losing a public transport

30
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,880
vehicle for a certain amount of time while it's under repair, and then also the devastation it'll

31
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,120
cause the passengers and the cars. Our pilot program at the moment, instead of trying to stop

32
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:23,980
the car, it can read the speed of the approaching vehicle, make an assisted, educated decision that

33
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:31,980
this car will not stop in time for the red light, and instead it will stop the tram. It'll remove any

34
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,060
possibility for the public vehicle to cross the path of the speeding car. Now if we were to try

35
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,340
and introduce that based on people, it would be impossible. You would need one person per

36
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,580
intersection 24 hours a day to watch it. However, one AI system could watch over every single

37
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,500
junction that has a sensor that is monitoring all this data.

38
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,980
Which brings me to my real point. The ability for us to introduce AI and systems like this in

39
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,520
the future comes down to sensors. It comes down to the quality of the data that we are able to

40
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:12,340
collect in real time and bring on our cities. Really, we know AI won't really impact our lives.

41
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,160
We have a lovely saying in Ireland and Europe that a society grows stronger when its residents

42
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,660
plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. And this is what it's about. It is our

43
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:23,960
job to make sure that we have the data that we need to make sure that we have the data that we

44
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,440
need to put in the sensors so that the next generation can create life-changing AI applications.

45
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,480
We have made a small sensor for one of my most favourite projects that we have at the moment.

46
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,760
There's a lot of drownings in Ireland and it's unfortunate because we are surrounded

47
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,440
by so much water. And the lunch boys that are used to save someone who is drowning

48
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,640
regularly go missing, being stag dudes, being people using them. At the moment they are not

49
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,320
intelligent devices. A ring boy is lifted, it is thrown in the water to save someone and it is gone.

50
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,600
We developed a small sensor that sits at the bottom of the ring boy housing. It tells the

51
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,800
council when there is a life boy sensor present, but more importantly when there is not.

52
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,640
This then triggers the council to go out and replace the life boy.

53
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,320
They are not at a great cost, but what happens is it saves a life by ensuring there is

54
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,640
constantly a ring boy at the location a person needs there to be. But as we start to introduce

55
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,400
AI in the future, and again with our partners in the UK we are discovering this, if we develop that

56
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,560
sensor to a point where we know that it is being used or it can prove that the ring boy is being

57
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,840
used in an emergency situation and someone's life is in danger, that exact same trigger can be used

58
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,240
to send out drones to find where the person is in the water. It can be used to find where the person is in the water.

59
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:00,280
I give an exact GPS location. If the drone then confirms someone is drowning, it can trigger the

60
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,920
emergency response to the location to make sure that person is saved in time at the exact location

61
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:14,360
where they are in peril. It's a fantastic opportunity to utilize all of the technologies

62
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,640
that are available to us and we are very excited to keep developing this sensor and more.

63
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,160
If you are interested, we will be doing a demonstration

64
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:31,720
of this full system. Neil might have to tell me the exact location. It's the Smart Dublin stand

65
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,560
at three o'clock today. We have designed all of the software, all of the hardware,

66
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,440
and currently there are 600 of these sensors installed around Ireland at the moment.

67
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,240
I don't have a huge amount of time left, but I would like to thank

68
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,640
you for your participation and listening as cleanly as you have. As I said, Neil and I will

69
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,600
be on the Smart Dublin stand for most of the day. We can take you through all of our other

70
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,240
applications of AI that we are using, but we firmly believe that this is the future

71
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:18,120
of smart cities and the sooner we can start to see it as an assisted intelligence instead

72
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,680
of an artificial intelligence, the better all of our cities and public spaces will be.

73
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,560
Thank you for your time. Welcome any questions.

74
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,760
Give it up to Gengover, everyone.

75
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,040
All right. Well, thank you very much for this very interesting presentation and how we are putting

76
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:45,640
safety of our users first. Now, we still have maybe just about five minutes in case anybody

77
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,880
would want to ask a question. We have the microphone here in the front, so don't be shy.

78
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,000
Come over and ask a question.

79
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,320
It's always hard to speak the first. Nobody wants to speak at the start.

80
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,520
Who wants to break the ice?

81
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,480
Anyone? Then Ken, in the meantime, because we discussed that

82
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,440
before, the other day in our call. How much do you use AI in your day-to-day life? How many

83
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,320
times do you use it per day?

84
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:20,280
No, I do. I use it a lot. I gave the example at the start of using it to control my calendar,

85
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,320
using it as an assistant to set reminders. I'm an assistant to a standard system, which I'm an

86
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,920
extremely forgetful i'm sure some of you are fantastic at making notes at conferences and

87
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,100
putting them into your calendar and all that but it is almost impossible for me i tend to

88
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,260
months after the event find a scrambled up piece of paper at the bottom of my bag and go oh they

89
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,280
were the notes i took on the day whereas now with ai technologies and it's as simple as the

90
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,640
microsoft applications yesterday microsoft were on stage with open ai talking about their

91
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,300
partnership they had their developer conference and most of the applications for ai are already

92
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:02,360
in your computer it's not something you have to download or sign up to chat gbt for turbo

93
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:09,740
even microsoft to do has so many applications where you can just speak to it in a conversational

94
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:16,260
tone and suddenly before you know it all of these triggers are set that can assist your day for

95
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,380
reminders for uh yes yes setting setting uh

96
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,220
tasks to do that you're most likely to forget so as a forgetful person that i am i should be

97
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,700
anyone wanting to ask a question to uh to ken

98
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,680
all right then i think people have noted down uh your 3 p.m

99
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,780
demonstrations so make sure to check it at the smart

100
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,340
stand excellent thank you guys thank you so much

101
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:50,340
all right so now we are moving to the

102
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:58,000
second one of our solution talks of this session this one coming from a little bit closer to to our

103
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,880
home these days and i'm delighted to introduce actually one of the partners of eit uh tomorrow

104
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,640
mobility event uh i'm talking about the planification manager at moventis nuria

105
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,640
gluminas

106
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
welcome

107
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
thank you

108
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:28,640
uh good morning uh first of all thank you very much for inviting us to this session

109
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,640
we're very proud to be here for those who don't know moventis moventis is moventia's business unit

110
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:44,640
dedicated to collective mobility this division brings together all the companies of the group

111
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,480
that develop their business through the transfer of passengers in buses in coaches

112
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:59,440
streetcars or other mortals transports like public rental bicycles or carpooling

113
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:13,440
moventis is focused on providing innovative solutions that contribute to get sustainable connected and safe mobility for all users

114
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,320
in 2017 moventis started to collaborate with the technological platform shuttle

115
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,340
in 2017 moventis started to collaborate with the technological platform shuttle

116
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,000
to implement a transport on demand line in the city of san cuvada

117
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,360
to implement a transport on demand line in the city of san cuvada

118
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,440
nowadays we are operating three transport and demand lines in this city

119
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,720
with shuttle's solution for the user this solution consists in an application

120
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:44,080
the user when wants to take a trip he makes the request through the application and it tells him

121
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,480
when the bus is going to pick him up i'll try to explain very briefly how artificial

122
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:50,560
i'll try to explain very briefly how artificial

123
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
intelligence has improved this platform

124
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,920
to create artificial intelligence we need algorithms and data

125
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:08,000
on the transport on demand case the algorithm must solve a problem called the dial or right problem

126
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,040
in this problem we have n requests k vehicles and some constraints like the capacity of the

127
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,320
vehicles or the hours of operation and the goal is to optimize the service

128
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,160
i i i don't think you can hope to get the correct answer

129
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
i i don't think you can hope to get the correct answer

130
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
it can be a little bit subjective depending on the operation

131
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,080
what does it mean optimizing the service well it can be a little bit subjective

132
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,600
depending on the operation to solve the problem we will use a realistic algorithm

133
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,720
and with these algorithms maybe we won't get an exact solution but we can get a

134
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,120
solution solution that it's pretty close to the exact one and the computational time is less than

135
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:58,480
algorithm that is an algorithm from 1959 if we have a lot of requests at the same

136
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,220
time with this algorithm that is very efficient we could take too long too

137
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,980
long to solve the problem that's why shuttle technicians decided to explore

138
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,980
other routing algorithms that would fit in the problem to compare the different

139
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,580
algorithms they studied the computational time required to solve the

140
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:27,940
problem and the efficiency respect the extra algorithm today the platform works with

141
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,160
four algorithms working in parallel and a timeout if the best algorithm gets a

142
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,200
solution before timeout the application will show these results but if the best

143
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,320
algorithm cannot get a solution before timeout then it will pass to the second

144
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,640
and so on to the fourth. another AI technique applied in shuttle is

145
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,720
clustering. when we talk about clustering we thought about grouping data in

146
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,960
clusters or groups trying to find characteristics that we wouldn't find

147
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:10,040
with our techniques. for example, shuttle has historical data of real trips where

148
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,520
they asked the users to score the satisfaction of the trip

149
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:22,660
The users have to score the global satisfaction, the waiting time satisfaction and the satisfaction

150
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
respect the delay.

151
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,760
When we say delay we mean the difference between the real drop of time and the expected drop

152
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
of time.

153
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:37,380
During this clustering we can see if each point is a trip, that there are three main

154
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,260
groups of trips.

155
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,580
The blue ones would be those where the user is more satisfied.

156
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:51,780
With the clustering we can find trip profiles and user profiles and this will help to personalize

157
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,160
the algorithm for each operation.

158
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,560
Because it's not the same taking the bus on a Monday when you have to go to work and you

159
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,820
need to be there at some hour or taking the bus on a Saturday afternoon when everything

160
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,220
is more relaxed.

161
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,220
So, that's it.

162
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:15,360
Another artificial intelligence technique applied is machine learning.

163
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,120
With all the historical data they train the machine so the machine can do predictions

164
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,900
on the demand.

165
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,540
With these predictions then the algorithm recalculates the time and gives a new expected

166
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,360
time that is more accurate than the first one.

167
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,540
So, if we come back to the day to day of Moventis we can see that the demand has been increasing.

168
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:48,220
So, we can say that artificial intelligence is now a reality in the transport sector.

169
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:56,200
With artificial intelligence we can provide a better service so we have happier users.

170
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,860
Thank you very much.

171
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,320
Thank you very much Nuria for this interesting presentation and this interesting example

172
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,680
actually pretty close from over here.

173
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,760
We still have a little bit of time for some questions.

174
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,300
If anybody would like to ask a question about Nuria's presentation?

175
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Let me see.

176
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Over here.

177
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:26,720
There is a microphone over there if you want to get this.

178
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Thanks for breaking the ice.

179
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Hi.

180
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Hi.

181
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
I am from the Netherlands.

182
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,220
I am not really familiar with the on demand services like you are explaining.

183
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,220
So, how does that work if there are no passengers, there are no buses?

184
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,220
So, I have a question.

185
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
I am from the Netherlands.

186
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
I am not familiar with the on demand services like you are explaining.

187
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,220
So, how does that work?

188
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,540
So, there are no passengers.

189
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540
Just on the practical side.

190
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,540
If there are no passengers the bus is stopped and it is not running.

191
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,540
That's all.

192
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,540
Is there a minimum of people that have to make a demand?

193
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,540
The service is planned so the driver is prepared to do the service.

194
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:03,300
We have the driver, we have the bus and if there is no passenger the driver is like this.

195
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Okay, perfect.

196
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Thank you.

197
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Thank you very much for the question.

198
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Thanks for another question.

199
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:15,300
There is another one over here.

200
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
Hi everyone.

201
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Thank you very much for the presentation.

202
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,300
So, my question is about when does it make sense to implement demand transport and what

203
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:30,300
kind of situation, what kind of values within the city or the rural realm and also how to

204
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,300
deploy a system from the beginning.

205
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
Thank you.

206
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
Well, usually we implement this kind of lines.

207
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
So, what do we do?

208
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:44,100
kind of lines in cities places with a low density where having a regular line

209
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:53,940
would be not efficient if I'm having passengers that in peak hour we know

210
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,540
that we can give the service with the demand bus

211
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:08,760
thank you any final question please I can come on to the microphone thank you

212
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,980
in the idea is that and if anybody would want to ask questions to stand on the

213
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,140
line

214
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,920
how much did you learn from other cities who tried similar approaches I know

215
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,460
Helsinki has something like this like maybe ten years ago

216
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:34,160
so how is this different or maybe just time you've changed so it's a better

217
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:42,260
situation now than it was before well probably all these platforms are yet

218
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,660
they were pretty similar way some years ago maybe 50 years ago we started trying

219
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,780
this kind of services with the typical series that the user had to call the day

220
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:59,520
before and had to say hey tomorrow I need the service now with all the

221
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:08,340
technology we can do it through this application and probably all the

222
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,700
people that is dedicated to study of this kind of algorithms are in contact with one

223
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:21,640
with other ones and they learn from one from one operation from from others

224
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,680
maybe since we still have one minute let's do it

225
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,360
I do have a final question

226
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,880
of the respect of the users because

227
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,660
anytime we encounter a new application a new app or new technology it's not always

228
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,600
easy to get people to use it yes how difficult or how easy maybe was it

229
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,880
for you for the users in Sankoogat to adopt the the usage of the shuttle

230
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:56,260
well we have the application and then there is a form for people that is not used to this kind of technology

231
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,220
at the beginning the percentage of people that was

232
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,520
requesting the service for the phone was around maybe 50%.

233
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Nowadays, the percentage is around 8%.

234
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,520
So, every time we have more people using the application,

235
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,520
less people have to use it.

236
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Very good. And then there's also people of certain ages

237
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,520
that don't necessarily understand the phone, but they can still call.

238
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,520
They can call, they can. Really interesting.

239
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,520
All right, Nuria, so thank you very much for being with us for the presentation

240
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,520
and for taking the time to answer our questions.

241
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Thank you very much.

242
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,520
All right, so we saw two case studies, two examples,

243
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,520
on how different AI applications are being used in Dublin and in Barcelona.

244
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Now it's time to discuss in more detail the innovations,

245
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,520
the implications, the policies needed, everything around

246
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
what do we do?

247
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,520
In terms of data and all other matters.

248
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,520
So stay tuned because in just a minute we're starting the panel discussion.

249
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,520
All right, and welcome back, everyone.

250
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,520
That was a short, that was a very short break.

251
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Well, as mentioned, we're starting the second part of our session,

252
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,520
so welcome everyone who is joining us just now.

253
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,520
After these two examples that we've been seeing on the case of

254
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,520
different artificial intelligence usage in urban mobility,

255
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,520
we're going to be diving deep on many topics, I think, from the perspective of

256
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:06,520
mobility providers to public entities to how cities can better cooperate with innovators.

257
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,520
So I would like to invite my panelists to join me here on stage.

258
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
I will introduce them in just a second.

259
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:37,520
I guess you can stay here.

260
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
Excellent.

261
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,520
So thank you very much to all of you for having joined this panel discussion.

262
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,520
I think we have a great speaker lineup and I'm very excited to discuss in more detail

263
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
such a fascinating topic.

264
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,520
I mean, we have a cool room just in front of us.

265
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Just next to me, I'm delighted to introduce the mobility innovation expert

266
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,520
coming all the way from London and the former head of innovation at Transport for London,

267
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
Mr. Rikesh Shah.

268
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Thanks for being with us.

269
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,520
Also with us is Anne Irefusta Barrena.

270
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,520
She's a technology director for industry and mobility at Technalia.

271
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Thank you for being with us.

272
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,520
On my other side, I'm delighted to introduce from the Frank Hofer Institute for Industrial Engineering,

273
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Marco Amorim.

274
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Hi.

275
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Hi.

276
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,520
So with us is the CTO and Assistant City Manager at the City of Pinched Tree Corners in the

277
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
U.S., Brandon Branham.

278
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,520
So I would like to start with you, Rikesh Shah.

279
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,520
When we talk about such a global metropolis, such a global city like London, what are the

280
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,520
opportunities that AEI has brought for its mobility network?

281
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
What can you tell us about that?

282
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Thank you.

283
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
Can you hear me okay?

284
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Yeah.

285
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
So I think the role of AEI is a new thing.

286
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
You know, AEI has been around a long time, since the 1950s.

287
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
And I just go to what Ken said earlier, it's really relevant, is when I wake up in the

288
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
morning, I might check my diary or I might then check the news, which is based on what

289
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
I want to read.

290
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
I might then do my journey planning.

291
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
So if I do my journey planning, people like TFL are releasing the data.

292
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
We release hundreds of data sets.

293
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
There are over 700 apps in London that are powered by TFL data.

294
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
And that's based on the data that we have.

295
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
So if I do my journey planning, people like TFL are releasing the data.

296
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
We release hundreds of data sets.

297
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
There are over 700 apps in London that are powered by TFL data.

298
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
And that's based on the data that we have.

299
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:27,080
And that's based on my preference, 42% of Londoners use an app that's relevant to them.

300
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,640
So that's a form of AI.

301
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,520
Then if I get onto the road, the traffic's optimized.

302
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,080
The traffic's optimized based on the traffic lights and how you work.

303
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
The city wants to control the traffic.

304
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,500
So what can I do?

305
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,200
Then there might be a road safety element.

306
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,080
So it could be a case of what data is coming out of the cars, what data is coming out of

307
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
the vehicles.

308
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,080
So actually the opportunities have been there for a long time.

309
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,860
And the opportunities will continue to be there going forward.

310
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,780
I think where we need to be clear is what are the problems that we're trying to solve

311
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,960
for our cities in the short, medium and long term.

312
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
And then what outcomes do you want?

313
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,220
And if we don't get that right, it just becomes a technology thing.

314
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,240
So we've got to contextualise everything really well, which I'm sure we're doing well today.

315
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Contextualising, indeed.

316
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,480
And I think already we've got some hints on really how do we put the needs of our passengers,

317
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,480
of our users first.

318
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,480
And we're going to be getting back to it very shortly, indeed.

319
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,100
Then I'd like to turn to Brandon Brown.

320
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,660
So the city of page three corners, it would be great if first of all, you can also put

321
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,740
us on the map.

322
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,300
I think that no one better to introduce us than you.

323
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,220
And how is it implementing AI in a smart city?

324
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,460
Thank you for those in the room.

325
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,120
We are just north of Atlanta, so 20 minutes from downtown Atlanta.

326
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,860
We like to say Atlanta is a suburb of Peachtree Corners.

327
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,720
But what we're seeing, obviously, in the metropolitan area, and Kim hit it on earlier, is traffic

328
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
is a major concern.

329
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,940
As we all know, the US is very car centric.

330
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,680
So how do we take use of the infrastructure to start to improve that?

331
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,460
We have a corridor that cuts through the heart of our city that carries 60,000 cars a day.

332
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,700
Right through the middle of our downtown area.

333
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,140
And so we're starting to do those things in traffic using the sensor sets that are on

334
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
there.

335
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,140
But then we decided to introduce an autonomous shuttle.

336
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,300
So how does that start to interact with the infrastructure?

337
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:31,600
So we use the AI sets that are on the sensor stack in the shuttle to communicate with our

338
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
infrastructure.

339
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,700
So we start to do preemption of traffic signals through that, and trying to find ways, because

340
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,700
in the US, public transportation is a major concern.

341
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:47,380
So how do we start to make it a viable option using AI in transportation and transportation

342
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,380
infrastructure?

343
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:55,380
Because I think how we're going to get there and the stuff that we're starting to do in

344
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,380
district orders.

345
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
So thank you.

346
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,380
Thank you very much.

347
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,380
I think, yeah, it's very, very interesting to see how different cities are implementing

348
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,380
solutions from all over the world.

349
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,380
So I would like then to turn to our next speaker, Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

350
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

351
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

352
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

353
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

354
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,380
Anaida Fustavarena.

355
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
Anaida Fustavarena.

356
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,380
Anaida Fustavarena.

357
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

358
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

359
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,380
Anaida Fustavarena of Tecnalia.

360
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:19,120
What are the AI solutions that you are looking into specifically and what do you think is

361
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,740
needed to scale them up?

362
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,740
Okay, thank you, Ana.

363
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,500
Thank you to Tomorrow Mobility for inviting us, Tecnalia, to reply to this relevant question

364
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,840
about upscaling solutions, AI solutions.

365
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:38,100
So we have seen two nice solutions in the first part of this session.

366
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:47,620
Well, I would first of all say that most AI developments remain as a proof of concept.

367
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,760
So it's difficult, they are tested offline,

368
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:59,760
and it's difficult to really have the whole life cycle for widespread errors

369
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,880
and for giving the necessary time to this whole life cycle

370
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,620
to really find or validate the solution.

371
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:16,220
So this life cycle needs to take into account ML, machine learning operations,

372
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,740
data operations, AI operations.

373
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,160
And so I think this is one of the most relevant aspects

374
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,480
that we need to take into account for upscaling AI solutions.

375
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:34,860
Then I think AI-based solutions must incorporate adequate management of the expectations

376
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:34,880
and the expectations of the AI.

377
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,780
So the steps must be incremental,

378
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:47,120
and an incremental roadmap, realistic, taking into account quick wins, must be applied.

379
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,260
Then access to skills, access to talent,

380
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:57,160
this is also something we need and it's relevant for the upscaling.

381
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,580
And the acceptance by professionals of a human-centered AI approach,

382
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,480
perhaps in the two nice solutions,

383
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:04,860
and one of the most important ones,

384
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,300
and at least that this is relevant and needs to take into account.

385
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,160
And then another clear aspect is the regulatory framework.

386
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,060
So this can be agreed at a global level.

387
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,960
These steps are taken to regulate the AI.

388
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,440
We have this sandbox on AI, the AI Act,

389
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,940
that will be defined and validated in two years' time.

390
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,640
So all of these steps are taken to regulate the AI.

391
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:45,620
So all this is needed, and I think these are, I would say, the most relevant aspects we need to take into account for the upscaling of AI solutions to the market.

392
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,660
Very interesting. You've put some important ingredients on the table. I've noted down the expectations, being realistic.

393
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,120
The access to skills and talent, when you were saying that, the room next to us was applauding.

394
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,120
So I think it probably resonated even in the other side of the room as well.

395
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,460
So these are all, I think, important questions that we will also take in the panel, indeed.

396
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:15,160
And then, last but not least, before I move, I open the debate, I would like to turn to Marco to tell us,

397
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:21,660
because you've been doing extensive research on how users perceive artificial intelligence.

398
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:29,040
So how would you assess it generally? The average user would perceive solutions of AI mobility.

399
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,500
What are their preferences?

400
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,600
What are the, I don't know, uncertainties or fears? What can you tell us?

401
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:44,500
Yeah, that's a good question, and quite a complex one, but so I will just point three main points that I think are quite interesting ones.

402
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,880
So the first one is habits.

403
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:53,220
So as humans, we are people of habits, so we like to stick to what we know, the way we do things.

404
00:30:53,220 --> 00:31:00,960
So usually we don't like to go out of our comfort zone, and we have some studies, for example, that shows that cities,

405
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,600
where there have been pilots for automated vehicles, shuttles, or normal vehicles,

406
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,340
people usually are more willing to accept those technologies in the future.

407
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,020
So this is something that can prove this fact of the habits.

408
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,200
The next part is trust.

409
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,920
So we need to trust these new technologies or new service.

410
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,300
And for that, there is always a question.

411
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,920
Is this service reliable?

412
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,220
I mean, I never used it.

413
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,000
Will it work?

414
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,900
Will it not work?

415
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,700
And for example, there.
